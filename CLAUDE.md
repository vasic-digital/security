## INHERITED FROM Helix Constitution

This module is a submodule of a Helix-family project (e.g.
HelixCode, HelixAgent, ATMOSphere) that includes the Helix
Constitution submodule at the parent's `constitution/` path. All
rules in `constitution/CLAUDE.md` and the
`constitution/Constitution.md` it references (universal anti-bluff
covenant §11.4, no-guessing mandate §11.4.6, credentials-handling
mandate §11.4.10, host-session safety §12, data safety §9, mutation-
paired gates §1.1) apply unconditionally to every change landed here.
The module-specific rules below extend them — they never weaken any
universal clause.

When this file disagrees with the constitution submodule, the
constitution wins. Locate the constitution submodule from any
arbitrary nested depth using its `find_constitution.sh` helper.

# CLAUDE.md - Security Module

## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md

All rules in `constitution/CLAUDE.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md` it references) apply unconditionally. This file's rules below extend them — they MUST NOT weaken any inherited rule. See parent root `CLAUDE.md` §6.AD for the Lava-specific incorporation context (29th §6.L cycle, 2026-05-14) and §6.AD-debt for the implementation-gap inventory. Use `constitution/find_constitution.sh` from the parent project root to resolve the absolute path of the submodule from any nested location.


## Definition of Done

This module inherits HelixAgent's universal Definition of Done — see the root
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/development/definition-of-done.md`. In one line: **no
task is done without pasted output from a real run of the real system in the
same session as the change.** Coverage and green suites are not evidence.

### Acceptance demo for this module

```bash
# Guardrails + PII detection/redaction over real sensitive-string inputs
cd Security && GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 go test -count=1 -race -v ./pkg/pii/... ./pkg/guardrails/...
```
Expect: PASS; exercises `pii.NewRedactor`, `guardrails.NewEngine`, `content.NewChainFilter`, `policy.NewEnforcer` per `Security/README.md`. For the adversarial suite, see `RedTeam/` and `make test-redteam-fixtures` at root.


## Overview

`digital.vasic.security` is a standalone, reusable Go security module providing content guardrails, PII detection and redaction, content filtering, policy enforcement, and vulnerability scanning interfaces.

## Module Structure

- `pkg/guardrails` - Content guardrail engine with configurable rules
- `pkg/pii` - PII detection and redaction (email, phone, SSN, credit card, IP)
- `pkg/content` - Content filtering with chain-of-filters pattern
- `pkg/policy` - Policy enforcement with rules, conditions, and decisions
- `pkg/scanner` - Vulnerability scanning interface with findings and reports

## Build & Test

```bash
go test ./... -count=1 -race    # Run all tests with race detection
go test ./... -cover             # Run with coverage
go vet ./...                     # Vet all packages
```

## Code Style

- Standard Go conventions, `gofmt` formatting
- Imports grouped: stdlib, third-party, internal
- Table-driven tests with testify
- Interfaces: small, focused, accept interfaces return structs
- Errors: always check, wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`

## Dependencies

- `github.com/stretchr/testify` - Testing assertions
- No other external dependencies
- No dependency on HelixAgent


---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

## Integration Seams

| Direction | Sibling modules |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Upstream (this module imports) | none |
| Downstream (these import this module) | HelixLLM, HelixQA |

*Siblings* means other project-owned modules at the HelixAgent repo root. The root HelixAgent app and external systems are not listed here — the list above is intentionally scoped to module-to-module seams, because drift *between* sibling modules is where the "tests pass, product broken" class of bug most often lives. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the rules that keep these seams contract-tested.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->



<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

## Lava Sixth Law inheritance (consumer-side anchor, 2026-04-29)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's Sixth Law ("Real User Verification — Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule") from the consumer's `CLAUDE.md`. Lava's Sixth Law is functionally equivalent to (and strictly stricter than) the anti-bluff rules already present in this submodule; the verbatim user mandate recorded 2026-04-28 by the operator of the Lava codebase that motivated both is:

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product! This MUST BE part of Constitution of our project, its CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD if it is not there already, and to be applied to all Submodules's Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD as well (if not there already)!"

The 2026-04-29 lessons-learned addenda recorded in Lava's `CLAUDE.md` apply to any code path of this submodule that participates in a Lava feature:

- **6.A — Real-binary contract tests.** Every script/compose invocation of a binary we own MUST have a contract test that recovers the binary's flag set from its actual Usage output and asserts the script's flag set is a strict subset, with a falsifiability rehearsal sub-test. Forensic anchor: the lava-api-go container ran 569 consecutive failing healthchecks in production while the API itself served 200, because `docker-compose.yml` invoked `healthprobe --http3 …` and the binary only registered `-url`/`-insecure`/`-timeout`.
- **6.B — Container "Up" is not application-healthy.** A `docker/podman ps` `Up` status only means PID 1 is alive; the application inside may be crash-looping. Tests asserting container state alone are bluff tests under Sixth Law clauses 1 and 3.
- **6.C — Mirror-state mismatch checks before tagging.** "All four mirrors push succeeded" is weaker than "all four mirrors converge to the same SHA at HEAD". `scripts/tag.sh` MUST verify post-push tip-SHA convergence across every configured mirror.

Both anti-bluff rule sets — this submodule's own and Lava's Sixth Law — are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies. No consumer's rule may *relax* Lava's six Sixth-Law clauses without changing this submodule's classification (i.e. demoting it from Lava-compatible).


## Lava Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** in addition to the Sixth Law inherited above. The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 in response to the operator's standing mandate that passing tests MUST guarantee user-reachable functionality and MUST NOT recur the historical "all-tests-green / most-features-broken" failure mode. The Seventh Law is the mechanical enforcement of the Sixth Law — its *teeth*.

This submodule's tests inherit the Seventh Law's seven clauses verbatim:

1. **Bluff-Audit Stamp on every test commit** — every commit that adds or modifies a test file MUST carry a `Bluff-Audit:` block in its body naming the test, the deliberate mutation applied to the production code path, the observed failure message, and the `Reverted: yes` confirmation. Pre-push hooks reject test commits that lack the stamp.
2. **Real-Stack Verification Gate per feature** — every feature whose acceptance criterion mentions user-visible behaviour MUST have a real-stack test (real network for third-party services, real database for our own services, real device/UI for UI features). Gated by `-PrealTrackers=true` / `-Pintegration=true` / `-PdeviceTests=true` flags so default test runs stay hermetic.
3. **Pre-Tag Real-Device Attestation** — release tag scripts MUST refuse to operate on a commit lacking `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-attestation.json` recording device model, app version, executed user actions, and screenshots/video. There is no exception.
4. **Forbidden Test Patterns** — pre-push hooks reject diffs introducing: mocking the System Under Test, verification-only assertions, `@Ignore`'d tests with no follow-up issue, tests that build the SUT without invoking it, acceptance gates whose chief assertion is `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
5. **Recurring Bluff Hunt** — once per development phase, 5 random `*Test.kt` / `*_test.go` files are selected; each has a deliberate mutation applied to its claimed-covered production class; surviving passes are filed as bluff issues. Output recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/bluff-hunt/<date>.json`.
6. **Bluff Discovery Protocol** — when a real user reports a bug whose corresponding tests are green, a Seventh Law incident is declared: regression test that fails-before-fix is mandatory, the bluff is diagnosed and recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>.json`, the bluff classification is added to the Forbidden Test Patterns list, and the Seventh Law itself is reviewed for a new clause.
7. **Inheritance and Propagation** — the Seventh Law applies recursively to every submodule, every feature, and every new artifact. Submodule constitutions MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any clause.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)" section. Submodule rules MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven. Both the Sixth and Seventh Laws are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clauses 6.I and 6.J (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.I — Multi-Emulator Container Matrix as Real-Device Equivalent** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.I. Real-stack verification, where this submodule's work requires it (per 6.G clause 5 / Sixth Law clause 5 / Seventh Law clause 3), is satisfied ONLY by the project's container-bound multi-emulator matrix where the consuming Lava feature touches the UI; for pure-library code paths covered here, real-stack means real implementations of all dependencies (real database, real HTTP socket, real cache backend, real timer, real filesystem) at the boundary the library claims to cover — not mocks of those dependencies. A single passing emulator (or single happy-path test) is NOT the gate.
- **Clause 6.J — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.J. Every test, every Challenge Test, and every CI gate touched by this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Adding a test the author cannot execute against the gating matrix is itself a bluff. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

## Clauses 6.K and 6.L (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.K — Builds-Inside-Containers Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.K. Every release-artifact build MUST run inside the project's container-bound build path (anchored on `vasic-digital/Containers`'s build orchestration: `cmd/distributed-build` + `pkg/distribution` + `pkg/runtime`), not on the developer's bare host. Local incremental dev builds on the host are permitted for iteration; the gate, the release-artifact build, and the build whose output goes through the emulator matrix (clause 6.I) MUST go through Containers. The accompanying 6.K-debt entry tracks the package additions (`pkg/emulator/`, `pkg/vm/`) that are owed.
- **Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate has exactly one job: confirm the feature works for a real user end-to-end on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre. The operator has invoked this mandate TWENTY-THREE TIMES across two working days; the repetition itself is the forensic record. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, immediately after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges!". If you find yourself rationalizing a "small exception" — STOP. There are no small exceptions. The Internet Archive stuck-on-loading bug, the broken post-login navigation, the credential leak in C2, the bluffed C1-C8 — these are what "small exceptions" produce.

## Clause 6.M (added 2026-05-04 evening, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.M — Host-Stability Forensic Discipline** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.M. Every perceived-instability event during a session that touches this submodule MUST be classified into Class I (verifiable host event), Class II (resource pressure), or Class III (operator-perceived without forensic evidence) AND audited via the 7-step forensic protocol (uptime+who, journalctl logind events, kernel critical events, free -h, df -h, forbidden-command grep across tracked files, container state inventory). Findings recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>-<slug>.json`. **Container-runtime safety analysis (recorded once in root §6.M, referenced forever):** rootless Podman has NO host-level power-management privileges; rootful Docker is not installed on the operator's primary host. Container operations cannot cause Class I host events on the audited host configuration. A perceived-instability event without an audit record is itself a Seventh Law violation under clause 6.J ("tests must guarantee the product works" — applied recursively to incident response).

## Clause 6.N (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.N — Bluff-Hunt Cadence Tightening + Production Code Coverage** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.N. Beyond the Seventh Law clause 5 baseline (5 random `*Test.kt` files every 2-4 weeks), bluff hunts now fire IN-cycle on three triggers: (1) per operator anti-bluff-mandate invocation — first/day full 5+2, subsequent same-day lighter 1-2 file incident-response; (2) per matrix-runner/gate change (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed); (3) per phase-gating attestation file added (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed). Bluff hunts MUST also sample production code: 2 files per phase from gate-shaping code (canonical list in root §6.N.2: `scripts/tag.sh` helpers, `scripts/check-constitution.sh`, `Submodules/Containers/pkg/emulator/`, `Submodules/Containers/cmd/emulator-matrix/`, the matrix runner's `writeAttestation` function) plus 0-2 from broader CI-touched code. Conceptual filter: "would a bug here be invisible to existing tests?". Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 ultrathink-driven discovery of the 7-day-old `pkg/emulator/Boot()` port-collision bluff that was invisible to all existing test-only bluff hunts. §6.N-debt tracks the pre-push hook implementation owed via the Group A-prime spec (next brainstorming target).

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.


## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config, runtime env var, or mounted file. Submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. Submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax this clause.


## Anti-Bluff and Quality Mandate

### Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor

> Verbatim user mandate: "We had been in position that all tests do execute
> with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the
> features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and
> execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the
> completion and full usability by end users of the product!"

**Operative rule:** Every PASS MUST carry positive runtime evidence.
No false-success results are tolerable.

**Bluff Taxonomy:** wrapper, contract, structural, comment, skip.
## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Lava-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.
<!-- BEGIN submodule-decoupling-and-reusability (parent-mirror) -->

## Submodule Decoupling & Reusability — MANDATORY

This repository is **shared infrastructure** consumed by multiple
independent consumer projects. Its specialized responsibility makes
it reusable — and that reusability is destroyed the moment any
consumer's specifics leak in.

**Hard rules when editing anything in this repository:**

- DO NOT hardcode any specific consumer project's name, platform
  list, paths, version strings, or release-naming conventions.
- DO NOT import / reference any consumer-project namespace.
- DO NOT embed consumer-project-specific governance, branding, or
  rule numbering in `CONSTITUTION.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
- DO assume N ≥ 2 unrelated consumer projects exist, even if you
  only know of one today.

Cross-project rules MUST be phrased generically ("every consuming
project's full platform matrix"), never with a specific consumer's
matrix hardcoded.

## CONST-047 — Recursive Submodule Application Mandate (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-14): *"Make sure all work we do is applied ALWAYS to all Submodules we control under our organizations (vasic-digital and HelixDevelopment) fully recursively everywhere with full bluff-proofing and comprehensive documentation, user manuals and guides and full tests and Challenges coverage!"*

Every engineering deliverable produced for the main project MUST be applied — fully and recursively — to every owned submodule under the `vasic-digital` and `HelixDevelopment` GitHub organizations. Each owned submodule (including this one) MUST receive in lockstep: (1) anti-bluff posture (CONST-035 / Article XI §11.9), (2) comprehensive documentation matching actual capabilities, (3) full tests + Challenges coverage with captured runtime evidence, (4) recursive propagation through nested submodules under the same orgs, (5) synchronized commits when meta-repo state advances this surface.

See the root `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-047 for the full mandate. This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md.
## §6.Z — Anti-Bluff Distribute Guard (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Z. No artifact may be distributed (Firebase App Distribution, Google Play Store release, container image push, this submodule's binary release, any future channel) UNLESS the corresponding end-to-end tests have been **EXECUTED — not source-compiled, EXECUTED** — against the EXACT artifact about to be distributed, AND have **passed**. Pre-distribute test-evidence file required at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>-test-evidence.{md,json}` with matching commit SHA, timestamp within 24h, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` (or per-language pass marker) verbatim in captured output. Cold-start verification is the load-bearing canary. Distributing a faulty version is a constitutional violation by construction. §6.Z-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` Phase 1 Gate 6 + pre-push hook check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 Galaxy S23 Ultra cold-launch crash on Lava-Android-1.2.19-1039 (Crashlytics `40a62f97a5c65abb56142b4ca2c37eeb` — `painterResource()` rejection of `<layer-list>` drawable); agent had skipped Compose UI test execution citing the wrong §6.X caveat. Operator's 26th §6.L invocation: "Anti-bluff policy MUST BE ENFORCED ALWAYS!!!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AA — Two-Stage Distribute Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AA. When an artifact has both a debug and a release variant (or analogous dev-vs-prod build types — including this submodule's binary release if it ships separate dev / prod variants), distribute MUST happen in TWO STAGES with operator-confirmed verification between them. Stage 1 distributes the debug / dev variant only; the operator verifies the **distributed** debug variant on the failure-surface device class. Stage 2 distributes the release / prod variant only ONLY AFTER written stage-1 verification, with the §6.Z test-evidence file appended with a `release-stage` section. No combined distribute permitted by default; the combined path requires explicit per-cycle operator authorization recorded in the evidence file. The R8 / minification surprise class on Android (or analogous stripping / production-only optimization classes on other artifacts) is the load-bearing reason. §6.AA-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` default flip + refusal of out-of-order `--release-only` + paired `last-version-{debug,release}` per-channel pre-push check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator directive immediately after the §6.Z forensic-anchor crash on Lava-Android-1.2.19-1039: "for purposes like this one we shall distribute via Firebase DEV / DEBUG version only. Once we try it, you continue and once all verified you distribute RELEASE too!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AC — Comprehensive Non-Fatal Telemetry Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AC. Every catch / error / fallback / unexpected-state path on every distributable artifact in this submodule MUST record a non-fatal telemetry event with sufficient context to triage the failure remotely. The Android-side canonical entry is `analytics.recordNonFatal(throwable, ctx)` / `analytics.recordWarning(message, ctx)` (lava.common.analytics.AnalyticsTracker); the Go-side equivalent is `observability.RecordNonFatal(ctx, err, attrs)`. Cancellation throwables are filtered automatically. Mandatory context: feature/module + operation + error_class + error_message (truncated 1024, no credentials per §6.H) + per-platform extras. Forbidden: silent fallbacks without telemetry; credentials/tokens/cookies/PII unredacted in event attributes. §6.AC-debt is open: Detekt + Go-vet rules flagging `try/catch` blocks lacking the telemetry call, pre-push hook integration. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator: "Add comprehensive Crashlytics non-fatals recording all over the apps and API so we can track in the background all warnings, issues and unexpected situations!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.

## CONST-048: Full-Automation-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.25)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that every feature, every functionality, every flow, every use case, every edge case, every service or application, on every platform we support is covered with full automation tests which will confirm anti-bluff policy and provide the proof of fully working capabilities, working implementation as expected, no issues, no bugs, fully documented, tests covered! Nothing less than this does not give us a chance to deliver stable product! This is mandatory constraint which MUST BE respected without ignoring, skipping, slacking or forgetting it!"*

No feature / functionality / flow / use case / edge case / service / application on any supported platform of this submodule is deliverable until covered by automation tests proving six invariants: (1) anti-bluff posture with captured runtime evidence (CONST-035); (2) proof of working capability end-to-end on target topology; (3) implementation matching documented promise; (4) no open issues/bugs surfaced; (5) full documentation in sync; (6) four-layer test floor (pre-build + post-build + runtime + paired mutation).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-048 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-048 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.25 for the full mandate.
## CONST-049: Constitution-Submodule Update Workflow Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.26)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we add something into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD we MUST FIRST fetch and pull all new changes / work from constitution Submodule first! All changes we apply MUST BE commited and pushed to all constitution Submodule upstreams! In case of conflict, IT MUST BE carefully resolved! Nothing can be broken, made faulty, corrupted or unusable! After merging full validation and verification MUST BE done!"*

Before ANY modification to `constitution/{Constitution,CLAUDE,AGENTS}.md` in the parent project, the agent or operator MUST execute the 7-step pipeline: (1) fetch + pull first inside the constitution submodule worktree; (2) apply the change with §11.4.17 classification + verbatim mandate quote; (3) validate (meta-test + no merge-conflict markers + cross-file consistency); (4) commit + push to EVERY configured upstream of the constitution submodule (governance files only — never `git add -A`); (5) careful conflict resolution preserving union of governance content (force-push forbidden per CONST-043 / §9.2); (6) post-merge `git submodule update --remote --init` + re-run cascade verifier (CONST-047); (7) bump consuming project's `.gitmodules` pointer to the new constitution HEAD in the SAME commit as cascade work.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-049 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-049 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.26 for the full mandate.
## CONST-050: No-Fakes-Beyond-Unit-Tests + 100%-Test-Type-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.27)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Mocks, stubs, placeholders, TODOs or FIXMEs are allowed to exist ONLY in Unit tests! All other test types MUST interract with real fully implemented System! No fakes, empty implementations or bluffing is allowed of any kind! All codebase of the project MUST BE 100% covered with every supported test type: unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, full automation tests, security tests, ddos tests, scaling tests, chaos tests, stress tests, performance tests, benchmarking tests, ui tests, ux tests, Challenges (fully incorporating our Challenges Submodule — https://github.com/vasic-digital/Challenges). EVERYTHING MUST BE tested using HelixQA (fully incorporating HelixQA Submodule — https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/HelixQA). HelixQA MUST BE used with all possible written tests suites (test banks) for every applications, service, platform, etc and execution of the full HelixQA QA autonomous sessions! All required dependency Submodules MUST BE added into the project as well (fully recursive!!!)."*

Two cooperating invariants:

**(A) No-fakes-beyond-unit-tests.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholders, `TODO`, `FIXME`, "for now", "in production this would", or empty-implementation patterns are PERMITTED only in unit-test sources. Every other test type — integration, E2E, full automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges, HelixQA — MUST exercise this submodule's real, fully implemented system against real infrastructure. Production code MUST NOT import mock paths.

**(B) 100% test-type coverage.** Codebase MUST be covered by every supported test type the domain warrants: unit, integration, E2E, full-automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges (vasic-digital/Challenges submodule fully incorporated), HelixQA (HelixDevelopment/HelixQA submodule fully incorporated, with full autonomous QA sessions executing every registered test bank with captured wire evidence).

**Required dependency submodules** (recursive per CONST-047): Challenges + HelixQA + any other functionality submodules under vasic-digital/HelixDevelopment orgs this submodule depends on.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-050 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-050 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.27 for the full mandate.
## CONST-051: Submodules-As-Equal-Codebase + Decoupling + Dependency-Layout Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.28)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"All existing Submodules in the project that we are controlling and belong to some our organizations (vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory - we can ALWAYS check dynamically using GitHub and GitLab CLIs) are equal parts of the project's codebase! We MUST work on that code as much as we do with main project's codebase! All on equal basis! Equally important! ... We MUST NEVER modify Submodules to bring into them any project specific context since they all MUST BE ALWAYS fully decoupled, project not-aware, fully reusable and modular (by any other project(s)), completely testable! All Submodule dependencies that are used by Submodule MUST BE acessed from the root of the project! We MUST NOT have nested Submodule dependencies but accessing each from proper location from the root of the project - directly from project's root project_name/submodule_name or some more proper structure project_name/submodules/submodule_name!"*

Three cooperating invariants apply to every owned-by-us submodule (orgs: vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory, plus any subsequently authorised org — discoverable via `gh org list` / `glab`):

**(A) Equal-codebase.** This submodule is an EQUAL part of every consuming project's codebase. The consuming project's engineering practice — analysis, extension, test creation, gap-filling, bug-fix, documentation (user manuals, guides, diagrams, graphs, SQL definitions, website pages, all materials) — applies to this submodule on equal basis. Coverage ledgers (CONST-048) list this submodule as an in-scope target.

**(B) Decoupling / reusability.** This submodule MUST remain fully decoupled from any specific consuming project. NEVER inject project-specific context (hardcoded paths, hostnames, asset names, naming schemes). Stay project-not-aware, reusable, modular, completely testable as a standalone repository. When parent-project info is needed, use configuration injection (env var, config file, constructor parameter) — never a hardcoded reach.

**(C) Dependency-layout.** Any dependency this submodule consumes MUST be accessible from the consuming project's root at `<root>/<name>/` or `<root>/submodules/<name>/`. **Nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN** — this submodule MUST NOT have its own `.gitmodules` entries pulling in further owned-by-us repos. Third-party submodules are exempt.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-051 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-051 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.28 for the full mandate.
## CONST-052: Lowercase-Snake_Case-Naming Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.29)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"naming convention for Submodules and directories (applied deep into hierarchy recursively) - all directories and Submodules MSUT HAVE lowercase names with space separator between the words of '_' character (snake-case)! All existing Submodules and directories which are not following this rule MUST BE renamed! However, since this will most likely break some of the functionalities renaming we do MUST BE applied to all references to particular Submodule or directory! ... There MUST BE reasonable exceptions for this rules - source code for programming languages or Submodules which apply different naming convention - Android, Java, Kotlin and others. ... Upstreams directory which all of our projects and Submodules have MUST BE renamed to the lowercase letters too, however root project containing the install_upstreams system command (it is exported in out paths in our .bashrc or .zshrc) MUST BE updated to fully work with both Upstreams and upstreams directory. ... NOTE: Rules lowercase / snake-case do apply to all project files as well and references to it and from them!"*

Every directory, submodule, and file in this submodule MUST use lowercase snake_case names. Existing non-compliant names MUST be renamed atomically with updates to every reference (configs, docs, source-code imports, governance files). Reference drift after rename = CONST-052 violation of equal severity to the rename itself.

**Common-sense exceptions (technology-preserving):** language-mandated case for Java/Kotlin/Android/Apple/C#/Swift INSIDE language-roots; vendor/upstream third-party submodules keep upstream names; build artefacts (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `target`, `build`, `bin`) keep tool-mandated names. The test "does renaming break the technology?" trumps the rule.

**`Upstreams/` → `upstreams/` transition:** the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` (exported via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`) supports BOTH directory layouts; lowercase wins when both present.

**Test coverage of renames** (per CONST-050(B)): regression test for reference resolution + full test-type matrix run + anti-bluff wire-evidence captured.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-052 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-052 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.29 for the full mandate.


## CONST-053: .gitignore + No-Versioned-Build-Artifacts Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.30)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"every project module, every Submodule, every servcie and apolication MUST HAVE proper .gitignore file! We MUST NOT git version build artifacts, cache files, tmp files, main .env file(s) or any files containing sensitive data, API keys or token! Any build derivate which we can recreate by executing proper mechanism for generating MUST NOT be versioned! We MUST pay attention what is going to be commited every time we are preparing to execute commit! If any violetion is detected it MUST be fixed before commit is executed!"*

Every project module, owned-by-us submodule, service, and application MUST ship a proper `.gitignore`. Forbidden-from-version-control classes:

1. **Build artefacts**: `/bin/`, `/build/`, `/dist/`, `/out/`, `target/`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`, `*.a`, `*.o`, `*.class`, `*.pyc`, generator-produced files when the generator is committed.
2. **Cache files**: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.cache/`, `.gradle/`, `.terraform/`, language-server caches.
3. **Temp files**: `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `*~`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`.
4. **Sensitive-data files**: `.env`, `.env.*` (allow `.env.example` placeholder only — no real secrets even as examples), `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `.netrc`, `secrets/`, `api_keys.sh`.
5. **Generated reports/logs**: `*.log`, `coverage.out`, `htmlcov/`, runtime captures unless reference assets.
6. **OS/IDE personal state**: `.idea/`, `.history/`, `.vscode/` (except shared settings).

**Anti-bluff invariant**: `.gitignore` line alone is not sufficient — no file matching the forbidden patterns may be CURRENTLY TRACKED. A tracked `*.log` despite the ignore-line is a violation of equal severity to no ignore-line at all.

**Pre-commit attention**: every commit author (human OR agent) MUST inspect `git diff --staged` + `git status` BEFORE executing the commit. Forbidden-class hits abort the commit until fixed (un-stage, add to `.gitignore`, scrub if already-tracked). Gate `CM-GITIGNORE-PRECOMMIT-AUDIT` + paired mutation.

**Secret-leak intersection (CONST-042 / §11.4.10):** a `.env` leak is BOTH a CONST-053 and a CONST-042 violation; rotation + post-mortem required.

**Recreatable-content test**: if a documented mechanism regenerates the file from sources, it is a build derivative and MUST be ignored. The committed sources MUST include the generator.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-053` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.30 for the full mandate.


## CONST-054: Submodule-Dependency-Manifest Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.31)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"We MUST HAVE mechanism for each Submodule to determine / know what are its Submodule dependencies so new projects or palces we are incorporate them can add these Submodules to the project root and make them available! Suggested idea is configuration file with expected Submodules Git ssh urls perhaps? New project can read it, and recursively add each Submodule to the root of the project and install / expose it to veryone."*

Every owned-by-us submodule MUST ship `helix-deps.yaml` at its root declaring its own-org dependencies. Schema: `schema_version`, `deps: [{name, ssh_url, ref, why, layout: flat|grouped}]`, `transitive_handling.{recursive,conflict_resolution}`, `language_specific_subtree`. Tooling: `incorporate-submodule <ssh-url>` adds the submodule at the parent project's canonical path (CONST-051(C)), reads `helix-deps.yaml`, recurses for each declared dep, aborts on conflicting refs, emits `<root>/.helix-manifest.yaml` audit record.

Anti-bluff guarantee: every manifest paired with a Challenge that bootstraps a throwaway consuming project, runs `incorporate-submodule`, asserts produced layout matches the manifest, runs the submodule's own tests against the bootstrapped layout, captures wire evidence per §11.4.2. A manifest without this proof is a CONST-054 violation.

§11.4.31 / CONST-054 is the **operational complement** of CONST-051(C): nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN — manifests are the bridge that lets consumers reconstruct the dependency graph at the parent root.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-054` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the dependency-graph layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.31 for the full mandate.

## CONST-055: Post-Constitution-Pull Validation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.32)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we fetch and pull new changes on constitution Submodule we MUST process the whole project and all Submodule (deep recursively) for validation and verification taht every single rule or mandatory constraint is followed and respected! If it is not, IT MUST BE!"*

Whenever a project's constitution submodule is fetched + pulled with any content change, the project MUST run `scripts/verify-all-constitution-rules.sh` BEFORE the new constitution HEAD is treated as canonical for any other work. The sweep re-runs the governance-cascade verifier AND every implementable rule gate (CONST-053 `.gitignore` audit, CONST-051(C) nested-own-org-chain audit, CONST-052 case audit, CONST-050(A) mock-from-production audit, CONST-035 anti-bluff smoke, etc.) against the post-pull tree. Failures populate the project's Issues tracker per §11.4.15 (Status: `Reopened`, Type: `Bug`); closure requires positive-evidence per §11.4.

Pull-time invocation: `git submodule update --remote constitution` triggers the sweep automatically (post-update hook OR commit-wrapper invocation). Operator-explicit manual invocation also available.

Anti-bluff: the sweep's own meta-test (paired mutation per §1.1) plants a known violation of each enforced gate and asserts the sweep reports FAIL for the planted gate. A sweep that exits PASS without running every implementable gate is a CONST-055 violation.

CONST-055 is the **enforcement engine** for every other §11.4.x and CONST-NNN rule — without it, new rules cascade as anchors but never get enforced.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-055` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the constitutional-enforcement layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.32 for the full mandate.


## CONST-056: Mandatory install_upstreams on clone/add Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.36)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every Submodule or Git repository we add or clone MUST BE upstreams installed using Upstreamable utility which MUST BE available through exported paths of the host system (in .bashrc or .zhrc) using install_upstreams command executed from the root of the cloned (added) repository - only if in it is Upstreams or upstreams directory present with bash script files (recipes) for all repository's upstreams!"*

Every clone / add of a Git repository under HelixCode MUST be followed by `install_upstreams` invocation from the repository's root IF its tree contains `upstreams/` (or legacy `Upstreams/` per CONST-052 transition) populated with `*.sh` recipe files. The utility (installed on operator's `PATH` via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`; implementation in the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` — already supports BOTH directory names since constitution commit `45d3678`) reads the recipe files, configures every declared upstream as a named git remote, and fans out `origin` push URLs.

Skipping the invocation when `upstreams/` is present silently breaks §2.1 (multi-upstream push is the norm) — the next push lands on only one upstream. Gate `CM-INSTALL-UPSTREAMS-ON-CLONE` + paired mutation. Automation: the future `incorporate-submodule` per CONST-054 auto-invokes; manual invocation supported. Pre-commit check: `git remote -v | grep -c push` reports expected count.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-056` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.36 for the full mandate.


## CONST-057: Type-aware Closure-Status Vocabulary (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.33)

Every project tracking work items by Type per §11.4.16 MUST close them with the Type-appropriate terminal `**Status:**` value, drawn from this 3-element closed map:

| Item `**Type:**` | Closure `**Status:**` value     |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Bug`            | `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`            |
| `Feature`        | `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)`      |
| `Task`           | `Completed (→ Fixed.md)`        |

The `(→ Fixed.md)` suffix is preserved across all three so the existing migration-discipline tooling (atomic Issues.md → Fixed.md move per §11.4.19) keeps working without per-Type branching. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh`, `generate_fixed_summary.sh`, the §11.4.23 colorizer) MUST treat the three terminal values as semantically equivalent (all "closed, positive evidence captured") while preserving the literal in the emitted document.

Closing a `Feature` with `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` or a `Task` with `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` is a CONST-057 violation. Gate `CM-CLOSURE-VOCAB-TYPE-AWARE` walks every Fixed.md heading + every Issues.md heading whose `**Status:**` is one of the three terminal values and asserts the Status-Type match. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.23.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-057` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.33 for the full mandate.

## CONST-058: Reopened-Source Attribution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.34)

Every Issues.md (or equivalent project tracker) heading whose `**Status:**` is `Reopened` MUST carry, within 8 non-blank lines of the heading, a `**Reopened-Details:**` line capturing four sub-facts:

- **By:** `AI` or `User` (source-of-truth observer who flipped the status). `AI` covers in-loop reopens (test failure, gate regression, captured-evidence retrospect). `User` covers operator-side observations (manual testing, end-user report, design reconsideration).
- **On:** ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Reason:** one-line cause classification — chosen from the closed vocabulary `{ test-failed | manual-testing-detected | captured-evidence-contradicts | end-user-report | cycle-re-discovered | design-reconsidered }`. Other values permitted with explicit `Reason: <free text>` annotation but the closed list MUST be tried first.
- **Evidence:** path to or short description of the captured artefact justifying the reopen — log file, recording, gate failure ID, operator quote, etc. Reopens without evidence are §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 violations (demotion from Fixed requires captured evidence under the conditions that re-exposed the defect).

The Issues_Summary.md Status column MUST distinguish the four `Reopened` sub-states by source so a sweep query for "reopens by AI in the last 30 days" is mechanically possible. Suggested column rendering: `Reopened (AI: test-failed)` vs `Reopened (User: manual-testing)`. Gate `CM-ITEM-REOPENED-DETAILS` mirrors `CM-ITEM-OPERATOR-BLOCKED-DETAILS` (§11.4.21 walk pattern). Composes with §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.15 / §11.4.21.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-058` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.34 for the full mandate.

## CONST-059: Canonical-Root Inheritance Clarity (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.35)

The **constitution submodule's** three files (`constitution/Constitution.md`, `constitution/CLAUDE.md`, `constitution/AGENTS.md`) ARE the **canonical root** (also called the **parent** files). They contain only universal rules per §11.4.17.

The consuming project's **repository-root files** (`<project-root>/CLAUDE.md`, `<project-root>/AGENTS.md`, optionally `<project-root>/Constitution.md`) are **consumer extensions**. They MUST start with the inheritance pointer (either the Claude-Code native `@constitution/CLAUDE.md` import or the portable `## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md` heading). They contain only project-specific rules per §11.4.17.

**When in doubt about which file to edit:** universal rule → constitution submodule's file; project-specific rule → consumer's file. Default consumer-side when uncertain (§11.4.17 — narrower scope is cheap to widen).

**Terminology:** "the parent CLAUDE.md" / "the root Constitution" → constitution-submodule file at `constitution/<filename>`; "the project CLAUDE.md" / "this project's AGENTS.md" → consumer-side file at `<project-root>/<filename>`.

**No silent demotion or silent promotion.** Moving a rule between layers MUST be a visible commit — `git mv` of a section if it's a clean clone, or explicit `Lifted from <project> to constitution per §11.4.35` / `Demoted from constitution to <project> per §11.4.35` commit-message annotation.

Gate `CM-CANONICAL-ROOT-CLARITY` verifies (a) consumer's `CLAUDE.md` opens with the inheritance pointer, (b) constitution submodule's three files are present at the expected path, (c) no `## INHERITED FROM` block in the constitution submodule's own files (those ARE the source-of-truth, not consumers). Composes with §11.4.17.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-059` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.35 for the full mandate.

## CONST-060: Fetch-before-edit Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.37)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that feedback_fetch_before_edit memory rule is part of our constitution Submodule - the root Consitution, AGENTS.MD and CLAUDE.MD. Validate and verify that Proejct-Toolkit and all Submodules do inherit all of them! Follow the constitution Submodule documentation for details."*

The FIRST git-touching action of every session, on every consuming project (owned or third-party), MUST be:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git log --oneline HEAD..@{u}
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git fetch --all --prune --quiet'
```

If `HEAD..@{u}` is non-empty, integrate the upstream changes BEFORE any local edit. Acting on stale local state produces three failure modes documented in the originating §11.4.37 incident (multi-agent / parallel-session work): (1) **redundant work** — the agent re-does what a parallel session already finished, (2) **false confidence** — completion reports for already-done work, (3) **divergent history** — duplicate sibling commits that double the conflict surface on next push.

**Anti-bluff invariant**: the fetch+log check MUST produce captured evidence — the actual `HEAD..@{u}` output, even if empty. Skipping the check on the basis of "I just fetched" or "nothing could have changed in the last N minutes" is a §11.4.6 (no-guessing) violation: the remote state is not knowable without a fetch.

**Cascade requirement**: This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-060` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the parallel-session-coordination layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.37 for the full mandate.


## CONST-062 — CONST-078: Round-191 cascade — anchors §11.4.42 through §11.4.58

The following anchors propagate from constitution submodule §11.4.42-58 (User mandates 2026-05-17 / 2026-05-18 / 2026-05-19) into this submodule's governance via short-form reference per CONST-049 step 6. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the respective enforcement layer. Cascade requirement: this block (verbatim or by ID reference) MUST appear in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and propagate to any nested owned-by-us submodule.

- **CONST-062 / §11.4.42 — Iteration-discipline mandate.** Each fix cycle MUST run pre-build gate + post-build/post-flash test + paired §1.1 mutation + post-validation §11.4.40 retest. Truncating cycle to ship faster = violation. Subagents default to this path.
- **CONST-063 / §11.4.43 — TDD-Fix-Discipline.** Every bug fix starts with a failing RED test reproducing the defect on the target topology. Fix lands only after RED → GREEN against real infrastructure. Skipping RED step = violation.
- **CONST-064 / §11.4.44 — Document Revision Header.** Every governance/status/plan doc MUST carry `**Revision:** N` + `**Last modified:** YYYY-MM-DD` + `**Maintainer:**` directly below H1; bumped per content edit. Missing/stale header = violation.
- **CONST-065 / §11.4.45 — Integration-Status-Doc Maintenance.** Every `Status.md` (integration, programme, sub-system) carries the §11.4.44 header and stays in sync with actual programme state at every commit advancing state. Out-of-sync = violation (CONST-044 severity).
- **CONST-066 / §11.4.46 — Validate-recent-work before post-flash sweep.** Each recent-work item since previous sweep MUST have its §11.4.43 RED test run against the live device and report GREEN before post-flash full-test sweeps. Skipping = violation.
- **CONST-067 / §11.4.47 — Firebase Data Review.** Every Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics finding triaged per §11.4.47 severity table, deduped against Issues.md; new stacktrace gets §11.4.43 RED test before fix. Untriaged past SLA = violation.
- **CONST-068 / §11.4.48 — UI-Driven Video Testing.** Every supported app/service ships UI-driven traversal tests covering surfaces A-E; each run captures screen-recording as anti-bluff evidence. Missing driver or missing video = violation.
- **CONST-069 / §11.4.49 — Dual-Approach Testing.** Every feature test ships in BOTH UI-driven (uiautomator) AND Intent-driven (programmatic API) variants. Both RED until fix lands, then both GREEN. Single-variant = violation.
- **CONST-070 / §11.4.50 — Deterministic Consistency.** Every test runs N iterations with consistent results; flaky tests forbidden; intermittent FAIL must be diagnosed not retried. First-PASS-only reporting = violation.
- **CONST-071 / §11.4.51 — Live-ADB-First Maximization.** Prefer live-ADB probes over post-flash sweeps wherever the fix surface allows (§11.4.43 step 2 maximised). Skipping live-probe when feasible = violation.
- **CONST-072 / §11.4.52 — Autonomous-Validation.** Every test/feature/flow MUST have an autonomous execution path (instrumentation APK / headless driver) so subagent flows run unattended. Operator-attended-only = violation.
- **CONST-073 / §11.4.53 — Fixed_Summary parity.** `Fixed_Summary.md` (+ HTML/PDF exports per §11.4.12/§11.4.44) regenerated on every Issues.md → Fixed.md migration. Stale exports = violation. HTML+PDF travel together with the `.md`.
- **CONST-074 / §11.4.54 — ATM-NNN ticket identifier.** Every Issue/Feature/Task entry carries an `ATM-NNN` id (zero-padded, monotonically increasing per project); cross-references in governance/plans/changelogs use the ATM-NNN id. Missing/duplicate = violation.
- **CONST-075 / §11.4.55 — Reopens-history + per-item Reopens.md.** Every Reopened item gets `docs/reopens/ATM-NNN.md` tracking each cycle (date, source AI/User, reason from CONST-058 vocabulary, evidence path). `Reopens_Summary.md` regenerated on every reopen. Missing per-item doc = violation.
- **CONST-076 / §11.4.56 — Status_Summary parity + two-audience format.** `Status_Summary.md` (+ HTML/PDF exports) ships in operator-side + AI-side sections and stays in parity with underlying status docs at every commit advancing state. Drift/missing audience section = violation.
- **CONST-077 / §11.4.57 — README.md doc-link section + revision metadata.** Every `README.md` carries (a) §11.4.44 revision header below H1, (b) Documentation link section listing canonical governance + status + plan docs. Missing section or stale links = violation.
- **CONST-078 / §11.4.58 — Parallel-development methodology (PWU).** Project work proceeds through the Parallel Work Unit pipeline: Stage 1 DEVELOP (parallel, isolated worktrees) → Stage 2 MERGE (serial flock + §11.4.41 4-step) → Stage 3 REBUILD+FLASH → Stage 4 VALIDATE (parallel) → Stage 5 SWEEP. Four-layer lock hierarchy: L1 flock / L2 git / L3 contention-path advisory / L4 per-PWU worktree. Disjoint-scope PWUs run fully parallel; cross-scope overlap rejected to rebase. Conductor REFUSES merge of any PWU lacking captured evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.52.

## Round-207 cascade — §11.4.59 + §11.4.60 (README always-sync + Documentation always-sync composite covenant)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-19): *"fully review and update our main README document. ... Make sure main README is among documents we MUST ALWAYS keep updated and in Sync with the projects and other documentation! Make sure we always export it (on every update) into PDF and HTML."* AND (2026-05-19 ~09:00Z): *"Double check if all documents are properly tied with our root Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD so they are always up to date, always in sync and exported into PDF and HTML! ... Issues, Issues_Summary, Fixed, Fixed_Summary, Continuation, Status and Status_Summary for all contexts (areas) — THEY ALL MUST BE REGULARLY UPDATED, IN SYNC AND CONSISTENT without giving at any moment false picture about the state of the project or particular area(s) of it!"*

- **§11.4.59 — README always-sync mandate.** `README.md` at the project root is a §11.4.12-class always-sync document: kept current with every doc/integration/Status.md change, lockstep with `docs/CONTINUATION.md`, exported to `.html` + `.pdf` on every update via `scripts/testing/sync_readme_export.sh` (auto-invoked by `sync_issues_docs.sh`), carrying §11.4.44 revision header + Documentation Map section linking every Status / Status_Summary / spec / plan / guide / script-companion / changelog + the constitution submodule + per-audience navigation. Pre-build gate `CM-README-EXPORT-SYNC` enforces mtime parity (README.html + README.pdf ≥ README.md). Paired mutation backdates HTML+PDF → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-readme-sync`, `--no-readme-export`, `--readme-stale-OK` flag.
- **§11.4.60 — Documentation always-sync composite covenant.** Eight doc classes (Issues, Issues_Summary, Fixed, Fixed_Summary, CONTINUATION, README, every Status.md, every Status_Summary.md) MUST be in sync at all times across `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` artefacts. Per-class anchors §11.4.12 / §11.4.44 / §11.4.45 / §11.4.53 / §11.4.56 / §11.4.57 / §11.4.59 / §12.10 govern individually; §11.4.60 binds them via single composite gate `CM-DOCS-COMPOSITE-SYNC` that FAILs the build if ANY instance's `.html` or `.pdf` mtime is older than `.md` mtime. Walks `docs/` recursively for Status fleet. Paired mutation backdates `docs/Issues.html` → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-composite-doc-sync`, `--allow-stale-html`, `--summary-not-applicable` flag exists.

**Cascade requirement:** These anchors (verbatim or by `§11.4.59` / `§11.4.60` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.59 + §11.4.60 for the full mandates.

## CONST-068: Shell-script target-shell-parseability mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.67)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-19): *"any issue we spot must be fixed, bash scripts as well if they are broken!"* + *"Make sure that this is mandatory rule!"*

> Verbatim 2026-05-19 operator mandate: *"all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner - they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected! We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completition and full usability by end users of the product!"*

Every committed shell script MUST be parseable by its target interpreter (`sh -n` for `/bin/sh`, `bash -n` for `/bin/bash`, etc.) AND MUST declare a shebang matching its actual syntax usage. Bash-only constructs (`>(...)`, `<(...)`, `[[ ]]`, `<<<`, arrays, `${var^^}`, etc.) used in scripts that may be invoked via `sh script.sh` MUST be wrapped in `eval` so the parser sees only a string (target shells like mksh parse the entire script before executing — runtime guards cannot save a parse-time rejection). Honest shebangs only: `#!/bin/bash` only if bash actually expected; `#!/bin/sh` requires POSIX-clean body. Fix at source per §11.4.1, never at callsites. Composes with §11.4.1 / §11.4.4 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.51. Pre-build gate `CM-SCRIPT-TARGET-SHELL-PARSEABLE` runs `sh -n` on every in-scope script. No escape hatch — no `--skip-parseability-check`, `--bash-only-script`, `--runtime-guard-suffices` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-068` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.67 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.68 — Positive Sink-Side / Downstream Evidence Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.68)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We still do not hear any audio played from D3 device! Arvus Web Dashboard when we play music from D3 shows nothing for Codec In Use! This MUST BE investigated and fixed! How come we passed the tests with Arvus validation? What were values for the Codec In Use field? Empty means nothing! This is not working! It MUST BE FIXED, TESTED AND VERIFIED WITH FULL AUTOMATION TESTING ASAP!!!"*

A test that asserts audio or video routing PASS MUST capture and verify **positive sink-side or downstream evidence** — never config-only, never metadata-only, never PCM-open-state-only. At least one of the closed enumeration MUST be captured for every audio/video routing PASS: (1) sink-side codec-state with non-empty Codec-In-Use matching the expected codec regex; (2) strictly-positive PCM frames-written delta from `/proc/asound/.../status hw_ptr`; (3) ALSA ELD/EDID-Like-Data showing negotiated channel count + format; (4) ffprobe-on-captured-mp4 with non-zero frame count + expected codec/resolution/fps; (5) recording-analyzer event match per §11.4.2/§11.4.5; (6) tinycap RMS amplitude above the line-level floor. Empty / `<unreachable>` / `<N.E.>` / `<None>` placeholders are NOT positive evidence; a missing-but-required sink is `OPERATOR-BLOCKED` (release-blocker), never SKIP, never PASS. No escape hatch — no `--skip-sink-evidence`, `--allow-empty-codec`, `--sink-unreachable-is-pass`, `--metadata-only-suffices` flag exists.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.68` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the sink-side-evidence layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.68 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.70 — Subagent-Driven Execution Is The Default (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.70)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Always do if possible Subagent-driven! Add this into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. This should be the default choice ALWAYS!"*

When executing implementation plans (or any task-decomposed execution flow), the **default execution model is subagent-driven** per `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Inline execution is permitted ONLY when (a) the task is trivial AND fits a single sub-300-line edit, OR (b) the operator explicitly requests inline at brainstorm-handoff time. Subagent-driven is the default because it gives isolated context per task, naturally enforces two-stage review, is parallel-PWU compatible (§11.4.58), creates an anti-bluff seam (§11.4), and survives operator absence. No escape hatch — `--inline-execution-required`, `--no-subagents`, `--monolithic-execution` are NOT permitted flags. Skipping subagent-driven for non-trivial work without recorded operator authorisation is itself a §11.4 PASS-bluff.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.70` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the execution-model layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.70 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.71 — Pre-Push Fetch + Investigate + Integrate Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.71)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"before pushing changes to any upstream for any repository - main repo or Submodule, we MUST fetch and pull all changes. Once these are obtained WE MUST investigate what is different compared to head position we were on last time before fetching and pulling new changes! We MUST understand what is done and for what purpose, easpecially how that does affect our project and our System in general! Any mandatory changes or improvements required by fresh changes we just have brough in MUST BE incorporated, covered with all supported types of the tests which will produce as a result of its success execution REAL PROOFS of working for all componetns and functionalities covered and work fully in anti-bluff manner!"*

The everyday-push variant of §11.4.41. EVERY push (every repository — main + every submodule) MUST follow the 5-step cycle: (1) fetch all remotes (`git fetch --all --prune --tags`, capture stdout); (2) pull all upstream branches whose tip differs, resolving conflicts per consumer judgment (never auto-`--ours`/`--theirs`); (3) investigate the diff vs OUR previous HEAD — read EVERY foreign commit's body, understand what/why/how-it-affects-our-system; (4) integrate mandatory changes with §11.4.4(b) four-layer coverage + §11.4.43 TDD-fix discipline, every PASS carrying §11.4.5 captured-evidence (REAL PROOFS, not metadata-only); (5) only then push, verifying with `git ls-remote` post-push. No escape hatch — no `--skip-fetch`, `--no-investigate`, `--fast-push`, `--trust-upstream` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.71` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the push-discipline layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.71 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.72 — Audio Top-Priority Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.72)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Make sure all fixes for audio are always top priority in main working stream!"*

The conductor (main working stream — Claude Code session, AI agent, or human operator) MUST treat audio fixes as the highest-priority class on the serial dispatch queue. Any time the conductor faces a choice between dispatching an audio task vs a non-audio task on the SAME serial resource, the audio task wins. Parallel BACKGROUND subagents (research, refactors, infrastructure documentation) MAY run concurrently with audio work but do NOT preempt audio on the main-stream serial dispatch queue. No escape hatch — there is no "but this non-audio task is faster" or "but this research is more interesting" override; audio-stack regressions are user-perceptible and high-impact while research and refactors can wait.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.72` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a process violation at the dispatch-priority layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.72 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.73 — Main-Specification Document Versioning + Revision Discipline (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.73)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Make sure everything we add now in previous and upcoming requests IS ALWAYS applied to the main specification — if we have one. Since all these are not major changes we could increase Specification version per change for secondary version instead of the primary. Primary version MUST BE increased for much bigger levels of changes! Add this into root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md as mandatory rule / constraint applicable ONLY IF we have something like the main specification document or we do recognize something like the main specification document. Document MUST BE updated ALWAYS to follow the versioning rules we are appling here + revision and other properties we have!"*

Applies **only when a project recognises a main specification document**. When it does: (1) every additive operator requirement, refinement, or accepted recommendation MUST be applied to the spec before or as part of the implementing work; (2) spec versioning has two axes — *primary* (V1/V2/V3, bumped for major rewrites by explicit operator decision, old versions archived) and *secondary* (the §11.4.61 metadata-table `Revision` integer, bumped for every other change); (3) the metadata table MUST stay current (`Revision`, `Last modified`, `Status summary`, `Fixed`); (4) propagated copies of the rule MUST reference the active `specification.V<primary>.md`, not a stale archive; (5) on primary bump the old file moves to `<spec-dir>/archive/` with `Status: superseded`. Classification: universal, applicable conditionally per the scope condition.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.73` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a release blocker when a project has a main spec and lets it drift.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.73 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.74 — Submodule-Catalogue-First Discovery + Extend-Don't-Reimplement (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.74)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We MUST ALWAYS check which already developed features / functionalities do exist as a part of our comprehensive Submodules catalogue located in vasic-digital and HelixDevelopment organizations on GitHub and GitLab both! Project MUST BE aware of all its existence so we do not implement same things multiple times if they are already done as some of existing universal, reusable general development purpose Submodules! For any missing features that some Submodules we incorporate may be missing we MUST IMPLEMENT the properly and extend those Submodules furter! We do control all of the and we CAN and MUST maintain and extend the regularly! All development cycle rules we have MUST BE applied to them and fully respected!"*

Before scaffolding ANY new module, package, helper, or utility, the contributor (human or AI agent) MUST: (1) survey the canonical Submodule catalogue — `vasic-digital` and `HelixDevelopment` on both GitHub AND GitLab; (2) inventory existing Submodules; (3) reuse before reimplement — if a Submodule provides the functionality (or 80%+ of it), add it as a Git submodule rather than write fresh; (4) extend in-place when 80%+ matches but features are missing — add the missing features TO THAT SUBMODULE (PR upstream + bump pointer), never as a duplicating consuming-project helper; (5) apply all development-cycle rules to those Submodules; (6) document the survey result in the feature's tracker entry with a `Catalogue-Check:` field (`reuse <org/repo>@<sha>` / `extend <org/repo>@<sha>` / `no-match <date>`). Classification: universal.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.74` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a process violation; duplicate implementations landed without catalogue check are release blockers.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.74 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.78 — CodeGraph code-intelligence mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule)

Inherited from `constitution/Constitution.md` §11.4.78. Every project worked on by AI coding agents — and every owned submodule when developed standalone — MUST install, initialize, and use **CodeGraph** (`https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph`, npm package `@colbymchenry/codegraph`): a local SQLite semantic code-knowledge-graph exposed to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol (MCP), 100% local with no cloud or external API. Install globally via npm (no `sudo` — the npm prefix MUST be user-writable). Run `codegraph init` + `codegraph index`: `.codegraph/config.json` is tracked; `.codegraph/codegraph.db` is gitignored with `codegraph index` as its §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism; the `config.json` `exclude` list MUST exclude other-owned submodules and — non-negotiably — every §11.4.10 credential/secret path. Wire the `codegraph serve --mcp` MCP server into every CLI agent the developers use (Claude Code `.mcp.json`, OpenCode `opencode.json`, Qwen Code `.qwen/settings.json`, Crush `.crush.json`, Kimi CLI `~/.kimi/mcp.json`); every config references the bare `codegraph` command on `PATH`. Cover the integration with an anti-bluff verification suite whose per-agent end-to-end layer uses an unforgeable challenge (a fact obtainable only by calling a CodeGraph MCP tool); un-runnable agents are documented SKIP gaps per §11.4.3, never faked PASSes. Document everything in `docs/CODEGRAPH.md`.

**Cascade requirement:** this anchor (verbatim or by §11.4.78 ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `QWEN.md`. See the constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.78 for the full mandate. Non-compliance is a process violation.

## §11.4.69 — Universal Sink-Side Positive-Evidence Taxonomy + Mechanical Enforcement (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.69)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"THIS MUST HAPPEN NEVER AGAIN!!! We MUST HAVE this all working! Not just for audio but for every single piece of the System!!! Proper full automation when executed with success MUST MEAN that manual testing will be as much positive at least regarding the success results! ... Solution MUST BE universal, generic that solves working flows for all System components and for all future and all existing projects! ... Everything we do MUST BE validated and verified with rock-solid proofs and anti-bluff policy enforcement and fulfillment!"*

Universal generalisation of §11.4.68 (audio-specific) across every user-visible feature class. Every user-visible feature MUST map to one entry in the closed-set §11.4.69 sink-side evidence taxonomy (`audio_output`, `audio_input`, `video_display`, `network_throughput`, `network_connectivity`, `bluetooth_a2dp`, `bluetooth_pair`, `touch_input`, `sensor`, `gpu_render`, `storage_read`, `storage_write`, `mediacodec_decode`, `mediacodec_encode`, `miracast`, `cast`, `boot_service`, `package_install`, `permission_grant`, `wifi_link`, `wifi_throughput`, `ethernet_link`, `display_topology`, `drm_playback`, `subtitle_render` — open to additions, never contraction). Every PASS for a feature in the taxonomy MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path matching the required evidence shape. New helper contracts (additive during grace, mandatory after 2026-06-19): `ab_pass_with_evidence <description> <evidence_path>` (verifies path exists + non-empty), `ab_skip_with_reason <description> <closed-set-reason>` (reasons: `geo_restricted`, `operator_attended`, `hardware_not_present`, `topology_unsupported`, `network_unreachable_external`, `feature_disabled_by_config`; forbids `network_unreachable_external` for any taxonomy feature with a sink-side probe); bare `ab_pass` deprecated (WARN pre-grace, FAIL post-grace). Three pre-build gates + paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-SINK-EVIDENCE-PER-FEATURE`, `CM-NO-FAIL-OPEN-SKIP`, `CM-AB-PASS-WITH-EVIDENCE-EVERYWHERE`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-evidence`, `--config-only-pass`, `--allow-fail-open-skip`, `--legacy-ab-pass-permitted` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.69` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-69-PROPAGATION` enforces the anchor literal across the consumer fleet; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the sink-side-evidence layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.69 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.75 — Mechanical Enforcement Without Exception (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.75)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Why do these violations still happen!? This is a serious problem! We cannot rely on stability nor consistency if we cannot respect our Constitution, mandatory rules and constraints! Is there a way to make this always respected, followed and applied without exception fully and unconditionally!? WE MUST HAVE THIS WORKING FLAWLESSLY!!! Do investigate the root causes of such problems! Once all problems are identified WE MUST apply proper mechanisms for this not to happen NEVER EVER AGAIN!"*

The §11.4 covenant historically relied on agent + operator vigilance; three 2026-05-19→20 forensic incidents proved that late-binding enforcement fires hours-to-days after the violator commit reaches every remote. §11.4.75 closes the gap with FIVE independent mechanical enforcement layers — bypassing any single layer does not bypass the discipline: (1) local `pre-commit` git hook (refuses staged `.md` lacking sibling `.html`+`.pdf`); (2) `commit_all.sh` integration (`_constitution_sibling_check` + auto-`sync_all_markdown_exports.sh` self-repair); (3) local `pre-push` git hook (re-runs siblings + propagation-gate subset); (4) `post-commit` auto-repair hook (auto-generates orphan-`.md` siblings, idempotent + recursion-guarded); (5) local-only final-gate ritual (remote CI DISABLED per User mandate — operator runs `pre_build_verification.sh` + meta-test before every tag per §11.4.40). Helper contracts: `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`, `scripts/git_hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,post-commit,commit-msg}`, `_constitution_sibling_check`. The `commit-msg` hook enforces a `Bypass-rationale: <reason>` footer when `--no-verify` is detected; `docs/audit/bypass_events.md` accumulates the audit trail. Five gates with paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-INSTALL-SCRIPT`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-SOURCE-DIR`, `CM-COMMIT-ALL-SIBLING-CHECK`, `CM-CI-WORKFLOW-PRESENT`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-hooks`, `--bypass-enforcement`, `--allow-orphan-md`, `--ci-not-applicable`, `--mechanical-enforcement-not-needed` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.75` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the enforcement layer.

## §11.4.76 — Containers-Submodule Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.76)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"For any work or requirements of running services or codebase inside the Containers (Docker / Podman / Qemy / Emulators, and so on) we MUST USE / INCORPORATE the Containers Submodule properly: https://github.com/vasic-digital/containers (git@github.com:vasic-digital/containers.git). Containers Submodule contains all means for us to Containerize our code and services! If any feature or Containing System is missing or not supported we MUST EXTEND IT properly like we do all of our projects! No bluff work is allowed of any kind!"*

For ANY containerized workload (Docker / Podman / Qemu / Kubernetes / container-backed emulators), every consuming project MUST: (1) install `vasic-digital/containers` (`digital.vasic.containers`) as a Git submodule; (2) consume via `replace` directive during development + pinned commit SHAs in production; (3) boot infra on-demand via `pkg/boot` + `pkg/compose` + `pkg/health` so operators are never required to start `podman machine` / `docker compose up` manually — the boot is part of the test entry point (the on-demand-infra invariant); (4) extend the Submodule (PR upstream) for missing runtimes / lifecycle primitives — never reimplement in-project (per §11.4.74); (5) anti-bluff: integration tests claiming to exercise containerized components MUST actually boot them via the Submodule — short-circuit fakes that bypass boot are a §11.4 violation. Tracker rows touching containerization MUST record `Catalogue-Check: extend vasic-digital/containers@<sha>` (or `reuse`). Planned gate `CM-CONTAINERS-USED` scans container-touching PRs for `digital.vasic.containers/...` imports; paired mutation strips the import + asserts FAIL.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.76` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-76-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.77 — Regeneration-Mechanism-Required Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.77)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We must be sure that after excluding anything from Git versioning we still have the mechanism which will out of the box obtain or re-generate missing content!"*

Every `.gitignore` entry excluding (a) >~100 MiB OR (b) any artefact essential to building / running / testing the project MUST carry a documented + automated mechanism to either re-obtain (download from authoritative source: vendor tarball, SDK installer, npm/pip/cargo/go-mod/container registry, dedicated git submodule, S3/GCS) OR re-generate (run from tracked source via build pipeline, code-gen, asset render, captured-evidence replay, container build). Required artefacts per qualifying entry: (1) `.gitignore-meta/<entry-slug>.yaml` declaring pattern + mechanism-type + script-path + expected-disk-usage + vendor-url-or-source + integrity hash + requires-network + requires-credentials; (2) a non-interactive entry in `scripts/setup.sh` post-clone bootstrap; (3) a pre-build gate verifying regenerated content present OR a recent `.gitignore-meta/.regenerated/<slug>.ok` stamp; (4) README + `docs/guides/*.md` describing the mechanism + manual fallback + time/disk budget + §11.4.10 credentials. Bare `.gitignore` additions without the mechanism are a §11.4 PASS-bluff variant — codebase appears complete but a fresh clone cannot build/run. No escape hatch — no `--skip-regen-mechanism`, `--gitignore-is-enough`, `--operator-already-has-content` flag. Planned gate `CM-GITIGNORE-REGEN-MECHANISM` + paired §1.1 mutation (strip a required YAML key → gate FAILs).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.77` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-77-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.77 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.79 — Own-Org Submodules MUST Be Included in the CodeGraph Index (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.79)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"All Submodules we use in the project and that are part of organizations to which we have the full access via GitHub, GitLab and other CLIs MUST BE included into the codegraph database and initialized / scanned / synced!"*

Refines §11.4.78's exclude-list with a per-submodule-ownership split: (a) own-org submodules (full write access via the project's CLIs — canonical orgs `vasic-digital` + `HelixDevelopment`) MUST be INCLUDED in the index; (b) third-party submodules (the §11.4.74 `no-match → vendor` path) MUST be EXCLUDED. Operational steps: (1) `git submodule update --remote --merge` to pull latest before re-indexing, respecting load-bearing pins on third-party submodules; (2) adjust `.codegraph/config.json` exclude list to keep own-org paths in scope; (3) re-index via `scripts/codegraph_setup.sh`; (4) verify via `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh` with ≥1 probe resolving a symbol living ONLY inside an own-org submodule; (5) paired §1.1 mutation — temporarily add the own-org submodule to exclude → validate MUST FAIL on the cross-submodule probe → restore. An index that lies about reachable symbols is a PASS-bluff against AI agents. Own-org submodules silently excluded without an audit trail in `.codegraph/config.json` comments is a release blocker.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.79` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-79-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.80 — CodeGraph Regular-Update + Sync Automation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.80)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"We MUST regularly check for the updates and execute codegraph npm updates so the latest version of it is always installed on the host machine! ... Make sure we have proper full automation bash scripts which will run regularly and that these are part of the constitution Submodule ... Make sure all updates, sync processes we do and important codegraph related events are all documented under docs/codegraph in Status and Status_Summary documents ... and regularly export them like all other Status docs into the PDF and HTML!"*

Three deliverables (all living in the constitution submodule, inherited by reference per §3 — consuming projects invoke at `${CONST_DIR}/scripts/codegraph_*.sh`, never copy): (1) `scripts/codegraph_update.sh` — npm-installs latest `@colbymchenry/codegraph` after a registry version check; appends old/new version to `docs/codegraph/Status.md`; anti-bluff verifies `codegraph --version` reflects the new version after install (npm exit 0 ≠ working binary). (2) `scripts/codegraph_sync.sh` — after a successful update runs `codegraph status` → `codegraph sync .` → `codegraph status` → the project's `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh`; appends every step's output to BOTH the project's and the constitution's `docs/codegraph/Status.md`. (3) `docs/codegraph/Status.md` + `Status_Summary.md` append-only ledgers, exported to `.html` + `.pdf` per §11.4.65. Cadence: weekly floor (per §11.4.45). A consuming project that has not run `codegraph_update.sh` in >2 weeks AND has open AI-agent work is a release blocker. Paired §1.1 mutation: downgrade installed version → script detects drift → restore.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.80` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-80-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.80 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.81 — Cross-Platform-Parity Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.81)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"Any Linux-only blocker / issue we have MUST BE created macOS and other supported platforms equivalent! So, depending on platform proper implementation will be used for particular OS! EVERYTHING MUST BE PROPERLY EXTENDED AND UPDATED!"*

Every consuming project whose supported-platforms manifest lists more than one OS MUST, for every feature/test/gate/challenge/mutation depending on platform-specific primitives, ship a per-OS-equivalent implementation chosen at runtime via `uname -s` (or equivalent detection). Three sub-mandates: **(A) Per-OS implementation REQUIRED** — Linux cgroup/systemd/`/proc` primitives MUST have documented per-OS equivalents (POSIX `setrlimit`/`ulimit`, macOS `launchd`, BSD `rctl`, Windows Job Object) chosen via runtime dispatch. **(B) Per-OS tests REQUIRED** — every platform-dependent gate test MUST have `case "$(uname -s)" in` branches with positive captured evidence per §11.4.2 + §11.4.5 in each branch; SKIP-with-reason acceptable ONLY when the platform genuinely cannot enforce the invariant. **(C) Honest kernel-gap citation + adjacent equivalent test REQUIRED** — where a Linux primitive has NO equivalent due to a documented kernel limitation (canonical: XNU does not enforce `RLIMIT_AS` for unprivileged processes), the test MUST detect the gap at runtime, SKIP with exact kernel reason + reproducer + honest-gap-doc link, AND provide an ADJACENT test exercising the closest invariant the platform CAN enforce (e.g. `RLIMIT_CPU`+`SIGXCPU` as the macOS proxy), itself anti-bluff with a paired §1.1 mutation. Gate `CM-CROSS-PLATFORM-PARITY` scans for `case "$(uname -s)"` blocks asserting a non-SKIP branch (or honest-gap citation) per platform in the manifest; paired mutation strips a Darwin branch → gate FAILs. No escape hatch.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.81` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-81-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker on multi-platform projects.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.81 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.82 — Iteration-Speedup Discipline Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.82)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"How can we speed-up this whole development and fixing process? ... Do not forget to all speed optimizations critical rules and mandatory constraints MUST BE all added into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and QWEN.md and all other relevant constitution Submodules files!"*

Iteration cycle time is a first-order quality enabler. Every consuming project's build / test / commit / debug pipeline MUST adopt these speedup disciplines AS MANDATORY (each independently enforceable): (A) Phase-1 forensic (`superpowers:systematic-debugging`) before any speculative source patch — speculative patches without FACT-grade root cause are §11.4.6 + §11.4.82 violations; (B) Live-ADB-First (or live-equivalent) before any rebuild — strengthens §11.4.51 to a release-blocker mandate; (C) 30-second pre-flight before launching rebuild orchestrators (device/sink reachability, host memory/disk, no stale locks, no orphan processes); (D) persistent build caches outside containers (`ccache`/`sccache`/Gradle daemon bind-mounted to host); (E) module-only rebuild for loadable-module-only changes; (F) parallel multi-device testing with separate `qa-results/<TS>/<device-tag>/` outputs; (G) subagent scope discipline + worktree isolation (≤30 min budget, single-responsibility, `isolation: "worktree"` default); (H) lock-file + stale-process hygiene (clean `.git/index.lock`, disable auto git-gc in concurrent repos); (I) cycle telemetry per §11.4.24 (commit hash, per-phase wall-clock, speedup-flag set, outcome — aggregated weekly). Gate `CM-ITERATION-SPEEDUP-DISCIPLINE` audits recent cycles for telemetry citing which of (A)-(I) applied; paired §1.1 mutation strips the speedup-flag column → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-phase1-forensic`, `--no-pre-flight`, `--rebuild-everything-always`, `--unlimited-subagent-scope`, `--ignore-locks`, `--no-telemetry` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.82` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-82-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.82 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.83 — docs/qa/ End-User Evidence Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.83)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded e2e communication transcript + any attached materials under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` (per-feature subdirectories). A feature with no QA transcript is itself a §107 PASS-bluff — it claims to work but has no auditable runtime evidence. Bot-driven automation MUST preserve full bidirectional communication threads as proof."*

Every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded end-to-end communication transcript plus any attached materials (screenshots, request/response payloads, audio, file uploads) committed under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` — one directory per feature run. Operative rule: (1) every consuming project MUST maintain a `docs/qa/` tree, each new feature under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` where `<run-id>` is monotonic + greppable (timestamp / ATM-NNN / other workable-item ID per §11.4.54); (2) transcripts MUST be full bidirectional — every prompt/command sent + every response received (one-sided is not a transcript); (3) attached materials MUST be committed in-repo (no external-only links — that is a §11.4.13 sink-side violation); (4) bot-driven / agent-driven QA automation MUST preserve the full conversation thread as the proof artefact; (5) release gates MUST refuse to tag a version that has any feature-shipping commit without its matching `docs/qa/<run-id>/` directory. A feature with no QA transcript is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff. Composes with §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.13 / §11.4.65 / §11.4.69 / §1.1.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.83` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.

## §11.4.84 — Working-Tree Quiescence Rule for Subagent Commits (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.84)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"no subagent commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate is in flight in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST `grep` its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, etc.). Any unexplained file in the staging area triggers ABORT."*

No subagent (or main-thread) commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate, paired-mutation experiment, or other in-flight mutation is live in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST grep its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, `// MUTATION` / `# MUTATION` annotations, `_mutated_*` filename suffixes, etc.) and explicitly account for every modified file in the staging area; any unexplained file → ABORT. (Forensic case: a logo-fix subagent's `git add` swept an `// always pass` JWT-verify mutation residue into an unrelated commit pushed to all four mirrors — a real security-defect window.) Operative rule: (1) pre-`git add` greps for mutation markers + cross-checks `git status --porcelain` against the subagent's declared scope; unaccounted entries → ABORT; (2) any active mutation gate MUST be serialised (mutate → assert FAIL → restore → assert PASS) and the working tree verifiably clean before any unrelated commit; (3) concurrent subagents in the SAME checkout MUST coordinate through a lockfile (`.git/MUTATION_IN_PROGRESS`) — cleaner solution is `git worktree add` per subagent (composes with §11.4.20/§11.4.70); (4) post-commit `mutation-residue-scanner` MUST run before push — any commit containing a mutation marker → push BLOCKED.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.84` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-84-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. A mutation marker that lands in a tagged commit is a critical defect regardless of how briefly it persisted.

## §11.4.85 — Stress + Chaos Test Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.85)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-24): *"Every fix or improvement you do MUST BE covered with full automation stress and chaos tests so we are sure nothing can break the functionality and all edge cases are monitored and polished and additionally fixed if that is needed! Everything must produce rock solid proofs and follow fully no-bluff policy!"*

Every fix or improvement landed MUST ship with full-automation **stress** AND **chaos** test suites exercising edge cases, sustained load, concurrent contention, and failure-injection. Happy-path coverage alone is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff at the resilience layer. **Stress** (closed-set): sustained load (N ≥ 100 iterations OR ≥ 30 s wall-clock, p50/p95/p99 latency recorded) + concurrent contention (N ≥ 10 parallel invocations, no deadlock/leak) + boundary conditions (empty/max/off-by-one, each categorised). **Chaos** (closed-set, per fix-class appropriateness): process-death injection + network-fault injection (drop/delay/reorder) + input-corruption injection + resource-exhaustion injection (disk full, OOM, FD exhaustion — refuse cleanly OR degrade, NEVER crash) + state-corruption injection (mid-flight lock loss, partial-write). Every stress + chaos PASS MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path per §11.4.5 + §11.4.69. Helper library `stress_chaos.sh` provides `ab_stress_run`, `ab_stress_concurrent`, `ab_chaos_kill_pid_during`, `ab_chaos_drop_network_during`, `ab_chaos_corrupt_file_during`, `ab_chaos_oom_pressure_during`, `ab_chaos_disk_full_during`, each composing with `ab_pass_with_evidence` / `ab_skip_with_reason`. Cleanup non-negotiable in `trap '...' EXIT` (cleanup failure = §11.4.14 violation). Four-layer coverage per §11.4.4(b) + paired §1.1 mutation (strip chaos-injection or evidence-capture → gate FAILs). No escape hatch — no `--skip-stress`, `--no-chaos`, `--happy-path-suffices`, `--stress-test-later` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.85` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-85-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.86 — Roster/Corpus-Backed Status-Doc Auto-Sync Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.86)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-25): *"Make sure that assets and players Status docs are ALWAYS regularly updated and in sync like all others Status docs — any time we add or modify the assets content(s) or we change or add new / remove existing pre-installed video and audio player apps! This MUST WORK OUT OF THE BOX!"*

Some Status docs (§11.4.45) are backed by a tracked roster (installed apps/components) or a tracked asset corpus (test/media asset directory) rather than narrative alone. Their freshness MUST NOT depend on operator vigilance — the moment a roster/corpus member changes (app added/removed/renamed; asset added/modified/removed) the Status doc + Status_Summary + HTML + PDF MUST resync out of the box, mechanically. Mechanism (all must hold): (1) drift-proof fingerprint — sha256 of the sorted member list (NOT mtime), persisted in a sidecar beside the Status doc; (2) a sync helper that regenerates the fingerprint + re-exports HTML+PDF via the §11.4.65 exporter, wired so sync is automatic; (3) a pre-build gate that FAILs when the live fingerprint differs from the persisted one (mirrors §11.4.12 `CM-ISSUES-SUMMARY-SYNC` + §11.4.45 `sync_integration_status`); (4) a paired §1.1 mutation corrupting the fingerprint and asserting the gate FAILs. Classification: universal — the consuming project supplies the specific docs, roster/corpus sources, helper, and gate name per §11.4.35.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.86` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-86-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.87 — Endless-Loop Autonomous Work + Zero-Idle Agent Dispatch + Anti-Bluff Testing Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.87)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-26): *"continue in endless loop fully autonomously"* (and any semantically-equivalent phrasing).

When the operator instructs an AI agent to continue in an endless autonomous loop, the agent MUST treat it as a HARD-CONTRACT covenant: (A) continue working until `docs/Issues.md` Status-column has zero non-terminal entries AND `docs/CONTINUATION.md` §3 Active work is empty AND no background subagent is mid-execution AND no external dependency is in-flight; (B) dispatch background subagents for parallelisable work — main + every subagent operate concurrently, "waiting for results" is the ONLY acceptable idle reason; (C) every closure lands four-layer test coverage per §11.4.4(b) with captured-evidence (audio/video/network/UI/sysfs physical proofs); (D) the §11.4 anti-bluff covenant family (§11.4.1 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.68 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83) is the operative truth-discipline — tests AND HelixQA Challenges bound equally; (E) the loop terminates ONLY on all-conditions-met, explicit operator STOP, host-session-safety demand, or scheduled wake on a known-future-actionable signal. No escape hatch — no `--idle-OK`, `--skip-endless-loop`, `--bluff-permitted-for-this-task`, `--metadata-only-test-suffices`, `--no-physical-proof-required` flag.

## §11.4.88 — Background-Push Mandate: Commit-Lock Release Immediately After Commit, Push Runs Detached (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.88)

Forensic anchor (2026-05-26): a single `commit_all.sh` held its flock ~5 hours because `do_push` ran synchronously after the commit landed — every subsequent commit blocked on a slow mirror push irrelevant to the local commit's durability. Implementation seam for §11.4.87(B) zero-idle. The mandate: (A) `.git/.commit_all.lock` MUST be released IMMEDIATELY after `git commit` returns 0 — the commit is durable on local disk regardless of remote push outcome; (B) push runs detached via `nohup ./push_all.sh ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` — the orchestrator's exit code reports COMMIT success, NOT push success; (C) `push_all.sh` acquires per-remote flock `.git/.push.<remote>.lock` so concurrent invocations targeting the same remote serialize but different-remote invocations run in parallel; (D) backgrounded push failures land in `qa-results/push_failures/<ts>_<remote>.log` — the next autonomous-loop tick checks per §11.4.87(A) "no external dependency in-flight" gate; (E) synchronous-push escape: explicit `--sync-push` CLI flag preserves legacy behaviour for §11.4.41 force-push merge-first audit paths. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-PUSH-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations. Synchronous push (without `--sync-push`) = §11.4 PASS-bluff at the execution layer.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.88` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond `--sync-push` for force-push events.

## §11.4.89 — Background Test Execution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.89)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Any tests we are executing, especially long test cycles, MUST BE performed in background in parallel with main work stream! This MUST NOT block our capabilities to work on queued workable items. Main work stream can be blocked or sit iddle only if absolutely needed and if it depends hard on results of some background execution."*

Symmetric anchor to §11.4.88 (background push) at the test-execution layer. Mandate: (A) long-running tests (>30 s expected: `pre_build`, `meta_test`, `test_all_fixes`, `recent_work_validate`, HelixQA banks, 4-phase cycles, full-suite retests, audio supervisors, dual-display recorders) MUST run via `nohup ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` with the log under a known dir (`qa-results/<test_id>_<ts>.log`); (B) the main stream proceeds to the §11.4.42 priority queue immediately; (C) hard-dependency gating — poll an exit-status file or `pgrep -af <test>` before steps that need the exit code, surfacing as §11.4.66 interactive options if the test is still running; (D) failures land in `<log>` files, the next loop tick checks; (E) foreground execution permitted ONLY for <30 s tests OR explicit operator authorisation; (F) per-script flock serialises same-script invocations, different-script invocations parallel. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-TEST-EXECUTION-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.89` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond explicit per-invocation operator authorisation.

## §11.4.90 — Obsolete Status + Per-Item Obsolescence Audit (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.90)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Bug No 6 ... seems obsolete after latest request for new behavior ... mark obsolete tickets with some light gray background ... text - the description to be strikethrough styled ... review all existing open or resolved workable items if they are obsolete - not valid any more ... There MUST NOT be any mistake! No bluff is allowed of any kind!"*

The §11.4.15 Status closed-set is extended with a terminal `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)` value (orthogonal to Type per §11.4.16). Obsolescence reasons (closed vocabulary): `superseded-by-design-change | superseded-by-later-mandate | feature-removed | duplicate-of | unsupported-topology`. Every Obsolete heading MUST carry an `**Obsolete-Details:**` line (Since + Reason + Superseding-item + Triple-check evidence) within 8 non-blank lines. The §11.4.23 colorizer adds a `cell-status-obsolete` class — light-gray `#E0E0E0` background + strikethrough description. Audit cadence: every release-gate sweep per §11.4.40 + §11.4.42; triple-check is non-negotiable per the operator mandate. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.21 / §11.4.23 / §11.4.33 / §11.4.34 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.71. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-90-PROPAGATION` + `CM-ITEM-OBSOLETE-DETAILS` + `CM-OBSOLETE-COLORIZER-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.90` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-90-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.90 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.91 — Summary-Doc Clarity Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.91)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Summary docs - Issues_Summary some not clear one line descriptions - like 'Composes with' ... For each workable item we MUST HAVE clearly understandable meaning ... every team member can clearly understand what that particular workable item is exactly about! There cannot be misunderstanding or unclearity of any kind and no bluff allowed!"*

Every summary entry (Issues_Summary, Fixed_Summary, README doc-link, Status_Summary pages 1+2, all one-liners) MUST contain a self-contained meaningful description ≥ 6 words OR ≥ 40 chars naming SUBJECT + PROBLEM/GOAL. Forbidden one-liner anti-patterns: section labels (`Composes with`, `Closure criteria`, `Fix direction`, etc.); bare metadata fragments (`Critical`, `Bug`, `In progress`, etc.); section-marker echoes; a §-letter alone. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh` / `generate_fixed_summary.sh` / `update_readme_doc_links.sh` / `generate_status_summary.sh`) MUST extract from the H1/H2 heading line per the §11.4.54 ATM-NNN convention, NEVER from arbitrary downstream text, and MUST refuse anti-pattern rows — emitting a `(MISSING DESCRIPTION — fix source heading)` placeholder with visual highlight. Gate `CM-SUMMARY-CLARITY-DESCRIPTIONS` scans every summary; an anti-pattern match = FAIL. Audit cadence: every §11.4.40 + §11.4.42 sweep.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.91` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-91-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.92 — Multi-Pass Change-Evaluation Discipline (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.92)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Every change to the project or codebase we do MUST BE evaluated in several passes and in in-depth analisys for potential new issues or problems it can introduce! ... no bluff of any kind! After we do change or set of changes this mandatory steps MUST BE taken!"*

Every non-trivial change MUST pass a 5-pass evaluation BEFORE it is commit-ready: **(Pass 1)** main-task verification — change achieves the stated goal, captured-evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69; **(Pass 2)** regression-blast-radius analysis — enumerate every direct dependency, demonstrate no contract break; **(Pass 3)** cross-feature interaction analysis — audit parallel features sharing state/timing/hardware/shell environment; **(Pass 4)** deep-research validation per §11.4.8 — external precedent OR "NO external solution found — original work" + CodeGraph queries per §11.4.78/§11.4.79; **(Pass 5)** anti-bluff confirmation per §11.4 / §11.4.1 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83 — no new bluff surface introduced. Each pass is documented (commit footers OR `docs/` entries OR `qa-results/` evidence). Only after all 5 passes complete may commit/push/test/release proceed. Trivial exemption: typo / revision-bump / MD-export-regen IF zero source touched AND the commit message cites the exemption explicitly. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-92-PROPAGATION` + `CM-MULTI-PASS-EVALUATION-EVIDENCE` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.92` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-92-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.93 — SQLite-Backed Single-Source-of-Truth for Workable Items (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.93)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"There MUST be single source of truth for all of our workable items - SQlite database ... proper scripts (we recommend Go programs) ... reduce a chance for sync to be broken ... generate always all docs from DB or to re-generate Db from all docs we have in opposite direction"*

The text-based Issues/Fixed/Summary/CONTINUATION constellation is converted to a SQLite-DB-backed single source of truth. Schema mandatory tables: `items` (atm_id PK + Type + Status incl. Obsolete + Severity + title + description ≥40 chars + created/modified + composes_with JSON + current_location); `item_history` (append-only audit per §11.4.34 By/Reason/Evidence); `obsolete_details` (§11.4.90); `operator_block_details` (§11.4.21); `firebase_metadata` (§11.4.47); `meta` (schema version + last sync + integrity hash). A Go binary at `cmd/workable-items/` provides `sync md-to-db` / `db-to-md` / `diff` / `validate` / `add` / `close`; bidirectional regen is byte-identical round-trip (closed-set whitespace/section-order tolerance). `commit_all.sh` refuses on non-empty diff; `sync_issues_docs.sh` invokes the Go binary; pre-build runs `workable-items validate`. Anti-bluff: unit + integration + stress (1000-row insert + 10 concurrent writers) + chaos (mid-write SIGKILL + corrupt-DB recovery + disk-full) + paired §1.1 mutation + HelixQA Challenge `CME-WORKABLE-ITEMS-001`. The Go binary lives in the constitution submodule (`constitution/scripts/workable-items/`) per §11.4.74. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-93-PROPAGATION` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-DB-PRESENT` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-MD-DB-IN-SYNC` + paired §1.1 mutations. (NOTE: the DB tracking rule is AMENDED by §11.4.95 — DB is TRACKED, not gitignored.)

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.93` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-93-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — text-based-only trackers are a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the data-architecture layer.

## §11.4.94 — Zero-Idle Priority-First Parallel-By-Default Operating Mode (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.94)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"We MUST NEVER sit iddle / wait or sleep if there is possibility for us to work on something ... Always check if there is a possibility to work on something while we are not working actively on something! Pick always by priority - most critical workable items and other tasks MUST BE done first! ... Stay still / iddle if nothing is left to be done at all or waiting for something that is blocking us / you!!!"*

§11.4.94 binds §11.4.20 + §11.4.42 + §11.4.58 + §11.4.70 + §11.4.72 + §11.4.82 + §11.4.87 + §11.4.88 + §11.4.89 into a single always-on enforcement: (A) idle ONLY when every queued item is genuinely blocked on an external dependency (hardware / network upstream / build/test completion the conductor cannot accelerate) OR operator STOP OR §12 host-safety — "don't see what to do" is NEVER valid; (B) before ANY wake/sleep the conductor MUST survey parallel-work feasibility per §11.4.42 + §11.4.72 + §11.4.87, identify non-contending items, and dispatch in parallel per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 (subagent) + §11.4.58 (PWU disjoint scope) + §11.4.89 (background long tests); (C) priority order MANDATORY — pick highest-severity + §11.4.72 audio-first the conductor can autonomously progress; (D) subagent-driven default for non-trivial; (E) background default for >30 s wall-clock work via `nohup`+`disown`; (F) stability-preserving (composes with §11.4.92 multi-pass + §11.4.84 quiescence + §12.6–§12.9 host safety); (G) progress updates surfaced at milestone boundaries.

## §11.4.96 — Safe-Parallel-Work-With-Long-Build Catalogue + Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.96)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Are there except AOSP build process any other active jobs being done at the moment? Can we work on something in parallel while build is in progress so we slowly cleanup our slate? ... do as much as possible work in background in parallel with main work stream and oreferrably using subagents-driven approach!"*

An operational catalogue for the canonical long-running workload (multi-hour containerised build per §12.9). **SAFE during build:** (A) MD/docs work; (B) generator/helper script work under `scripts/`; (C) pre-build + meta-test gate authoring + paired §1.1 mutations; (D) on-device test scripts; (E) constitution submodule edits + push; (F) any submodule commit + push per §11.4.88; (G) read-only live-ADB probes (`dumpsys`/`getprop`/`cat /proc/...`/`screencap`/`logcat`); (H) subagent dispatch per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 + §11.4.84 quiescence; (I) web research + external API queries with §11.4.10 credentials; (J) workable-items DB ops per §11.4.93+§11.4.95; (K) backgrounded pre-build + meta-test execution per §11.4.89. **UNSAFE during build:** (α) `git checkout`/`reset --hard`/`clean -df` on the source tree (use `git worktree`); (β) mass file deletes/renames under built source trees; (γ) submodule pointer updates affecting built artefacts; (δ) `out/` mutations; (ε) `make clean`/`m clobber`/`rm -rf out/`; (ζ) container destruction; (η) disk-filling breaching §12.9 free-space minimum; (θ) §12 host-session-safety breaches. Conductor responsibility: before EVERY pause point during a long build, consult the catalogue, identify (A)-(K) queue items per §11.4.42+§11.4.72, and dispatch ≥1 per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 subagent default + §11.4.89 background.

## §11.4.97 — Maximum-Use-of-Idle-Time + Progress-Update Cadence (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.97)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"keep it working, we should do as much as possible, if not it all but as much as we can as long as there is iddle time! it MUST be used! ... keep us updated about all progress and all phisycal proofs and gathered data as you progress through all open workable items!"*

Operating-mode capstone strengthening §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 + §11.4.96: (A) every minute of conductor idle time during which work could autonomously progress AND is not genuinely blocked = a §11.4.97 violation; "as much as possible, if not it all but as much as we can" is operative — dispatch CONTINUOUSLY through the entire idle window, not just at scheduled wakes; (B) progress-update cadence — emit an operator-facing 1-line update at every commit landed / subagent return / constitutional anchor / captured evidence / milestone closure, no operator prompt required; (C) continuous physical-proof gathering per §11.4.5 + §11.4.6 + §11.4.69 — every autonomous closure cites captured-evidence (evidence path goes into the §11.4.93 `item_history.evidence_path` when the DB lands); (D) composes with §11.4.5/6/13/20/27/42/50/52/69/70/72/83/85/87/88/89/94/96; (E) the idle-only-when-blocked closed-set is unchanged from §11.4.94(A).

## §11.4.95 — Workable-Items SQLite DB Is TRACKED in Git, NEVER Gitignored (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.95)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"We shall not Git ignore our workable items SQlite DB since it is our single source of truth ... workable items SQlite DB regularly commited and pushed to all upstreams!"*

§11.4.93's earlier "gitignored per §11.4.30" clause is AMENDED — the DB at `docs/workable_items.db` is TRACKED in git, NEVER gitignored. It IS authoritative source data, NOT a build artefact. Every `workable-items sync md-to-db` that mutates state MUST stage + commit + push the DB alongside the MD regen per §11.4.19 atomic-move + §2.1 multi-upstream push. A WAL-checkpoint (`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) is required before commit-stage so the transient `.db-wal` + `.db-shm` sidecars (gitignored per §11.4.30) are safely discardable. The §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism does NOT apply — the DB IS the source. Destructive DB ops require §9.2 hardlinked-backup + operator authorization; §11.4.41 force-push merge-first applies if DB history ever needs rewrite. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-95-PROPAGATION` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-DB-TRACKED` + paired §1.1 mutation.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.95` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-95-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
