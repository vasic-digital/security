# MANUAL PREREQUISITE — run ONCE per host, with sudo, BEFORE running
# any project test / challenge / build that boots containers or
# spawns long-running CLI agents.
#
# Background (CONST-032 / CONST-033): on 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host
# suspended mid-session, killing the running application + 41 services + the user's
# SSH session. journalctl showed:
#   systemd-logind[1183]: The system will suspend now!
# Root cause: the GDM greeter session at the local console has its own
# power policy; SSH sessions don't count as activity. User-level
# `sleep-inactive-ac-type=nothing` is necessary but not sufficient.
#
# This script applies defence in depth so neither the greeter, nor any
# DE, nor any user with logind privileges, can suspend the host while
# it's running mission-critical workloads.
#
# Verification (re-run the challenge after this script):
#   bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh
# All 4 assertions must PASS.
