## INHERITED FROM Helix Constitution

This module is a submodule of a project that includes the Helix
Constitution submodule at the parent's `constitution/` path. All
rules in `constitution/CLAUDE.md` and the
`constitution/Constitution.md` it references (universal anti-bluff
covenant §11.4, no-guessing mandate §11.4.6, credentials-handling
mandate §11.4.10, host-session safety §12, data safety §9, mutation-
paired gates §1.1) apply unconditionally to every change landed here.
The module-specific rules below extend them — they never weaken any
universal clause.

When this file disagrees with the constitution submodule, the
constitution wins. Locate the constitution submodule from any
arbitrary nested depth using its `find_constitution.sh` helper.

# Security — Constitution

## INHERITED FROM constitution/Constitution.md

All rules in `constitution/Constitution.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md` it references) apply unconditionally. This file's rules below extend them — they MUST NOT weaken any inherited rule. See parent root `CLAUDE.md` §6.AD for the consuming project's incorporation context (29th §6.L cycle, 2026-05-14) and §6.AD-debt for the implementation-gap inventory. Use `constitution/find_constitution.sh` from the parent project root to resolve the absolute path of the submodule from any nested location.

> **Status:** Active. This document is the project's authoritative
> rule set. When a rule here conflicts with `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
> or any guide, the Constitution wins.

## Mission

See README.md.

## Mandatory Standards

1. **Reproducibility:** every change is reproducible from a clean
   clone (`git clone <repo> && <project bootstrap>`); no hidden steps.
2. **Tests track behavior, not code:** test what the user-visible
   behavior is, not what the implementation looks like.
3. **No silent skips, no silent mocks above unit tests.**
4. **Conventional Commits** for all commits.
5. **SSH-only for git operations** (`git@…`); HTTPS prohibited.

## Article XI — Anti-Bluff and Quality Mandate

### §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (CONST-035)

> Verbatim user mandate: *"We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"*
>
> Operative rule: **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

## Numbered Rules

<!-- Rules are numbered CONST-NNN. New rules append. Removed rules
     keep their number with a "**Retired:** …" line. -->

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
the consuming application and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## Definition of Done

A change is done when:

1. The code change is committed.
2. All project-level tests pass on a clean clone.
3. All challenges in `challenges/scripts/` pass on the running host.
4. Governance docs (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) are
   coherent with the change.

<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

## Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

In addition to the Sixth Law above, this submodule inherits the consuming project's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** when consumed by the consuming project. The Seventh Law was added to the consuming project's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 to mechanically enforce the Sixth Law: every test commit MUST carry a Bluff-Audit stamp (mutation/observed-failure/reverted protocol); every feature MUST pass a real-stack verification gate; release tags MUST be preceded by a real-device attestation; forbidden test patterns (mocking the SUT, verification-only assertions, ignored tests without follow-up, build-success-as-only-assertion) are pre-push-rejected; a recurring bluff hunt and a bluff discovery protocol apply.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent project's `CLAUDE.md` under "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)". This submodule MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven Seventh-Law clauses. Both the submodule's own anti-bluff rules and the consuming project's Sixth + Seventh Laws are binding when consumed by the consuming project; the stricter of the two applies.

## Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)

Inherited verbatim from parent project's `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. The operator has invoked this mandate **TWENTY-THREE TIMES** across two working days. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag <project>-android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges! Any issue that pops up MUST BE properly addressed by addressing the root causes (fixing them) and covering everything with validation and verification tests and Challenges!"

Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate added to or maintained in this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, NEVER sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

Inheritance is recursive. Sub-submodules MAY paste this clause verbatim; they MUST NOT abbreviate or relax it.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (<project>-android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.

## CONST-042 — No-Secret-Leak (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

No API key, token, password, certificate, or other credential may be committed. All secrets in `.env` (mode 0600, gitignored). Any leak is a release blocker.

## CONST-043 — No-Force-Push (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

No force push, history rewrite, branch deletion of main/master without explicit per-operation user approval.

## Article XI §11.9 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (Cascaded)

### Bluff Taxonomy (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

- Wrapper bluff — assertions PASS but exit-code logic is buggy
- Contract bluff — advertises capability but rejects in dispatch
- Structural bluff — file exists but doesn't contain working code
- Comment bluff — comment promises behavior code doesn't have
- Skip bluff — t.Skip() without SKIP-OK: #<ticket> marker
## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal shall appear as a string/int constant in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config class, runtime env var, or mounted file. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent project's repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. This submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Consuming-project-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.
<!-- BEGIN submodule-decoupling-and-reusability (parent-mirror) -->

### Submodule Decoupling & Reusability — Mandatory

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable.

**Rule:** This repository is a **shared submodule** consumed by
multiple independent consumer projects. Its value depends on staying
**fully decoupled and reusable**. No change in this repository may
introduce coupling that breaks its standalone reusability for any
consumer.

**Prohibited inside this repository:**

1. Hardcoding any specific consumer project's name, paths, platform
   list, version strings, release-naming conventions, branding, or
   feature names.
2. `import` / dependency on any consumer-project namespace, package,
   or build coordinate.
3. Embedding consumer-project-specific governance, rule numbering, or
   release cadence into this repository's `CONSTITUTION.md` /
   `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
4. Assuming this repository is consumed by a particular CLI, build
   system, language toolchain version, or target architecture beyond
   what its public interface documents.

**Required inside this repository:**

1. All public surfaces (APIs, CLIs, configuration files, environment
   variables, scripts) MUST be expressed in terms of THIS repository's
   own domain — not any consumer's.
2. Governance MUST describe responsibilities and contract from THIS
   repository's perspective. Consumer projects appear as illustrative
   examples at most, never as load-bearing requirements.
3. Cross-project rules adopted from a consumer (such as a
   cross-platform impact mandate) MUST be phrased generically —
   "every consuming project's full platform matrix" — and never
   hardcode any single consumer's matrix.

**Why:** Repositories like this one have shipped changes in the past
where one consumer's platform list, feature names, or rule numbering
leaked into shared-repo governance — and then collided at merge time
with another consumer's parallel work, leaving the repository
unmergeable until manual conflict resolution stripped the
consumer-specific text back out. Decoupling is the only mechanism
that preserves this repository's value as shared infrastructure.

**Recursive scope:** any submodule this repository consumes inherits
the same decoupling+reusability rule. Third-party upstream submodules
that this repository merely vendors (e.g. open-source tools under a
`tools/opensource/` tree, if present) are explicitly out of scope —
we are not their owners.

<!-- END submodule-decoupling-and-reusability (parent-mirror) -->

## CONST-047 — Recursive Submodule Application Mandate (cascaded from root CONSTITUTION.md)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-14): *"Make sure all work we do is applied ALWAYS to all Submodules we control under our organizations (vasic-digital and HelixDevelopment) fully recursively everywhere with full bluff-proofing and comprehensive documentation, user manuals and guides and full tests and Challenges coverage!"*

Every engineering deliverable produced for the main project MUST be applied — fully and recursively — to every owned submodule under the `vasic-digital` and `HelixDevelopment` GitHub organizations. Each owned submodule (including this one) MUST receive in lockstep: (1) anti-bluff posture (CONST-035 / Article XI §11.9), (2) comprehensive documentation matching actual capabilities, (3) full tests + Challenges coverage with captured runtime evidence, (4) recursive propagation through nested submodules under the same orgs, (5) synchronized commits when meta-repo state advances this surface.

See the root `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-047 for the full mandate. This anchor MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md.
## §6.Z — Anti-Bluff Distribute Guard (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Z. No artifact may be distributed (Firebase App Distribution, Google Play Store release, container image push, this submodule's binary release, any future channel) UNLESS the corresponding end-to-end tests have been **EXECUTED — not source-compiled, EXECUTED** — against the EXACT artifact about to be distributed, AND have **passed**. Pre-distribute test-evidence file required at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>-test-evidence.{md,json}` with matching commit SHA, timestamp within 24h, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` (or per-language pass marker) verbatim in captured output. Cold-start verification is the load-bearing canary. Distributing a faulty version is a constitutional violation by construction. §6.Z-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` Phase 1 Gate 6 + pre-push hook check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 Galaxy S23 Ultra cold-launch crash on <project>-android-1.2.19-1039 (Crashlytics `40a62f97a5c65abb56142b4ca2c37eeb` — `painterResource()` rejection of `<layer-list>` drawable); agent had skipped Compose UI test execution citing the wrong §6.X caveat. Operator's 26th §6.L invocation: "Anti-bluff policy MUST BE ENFORCED ALWAYS!!!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AA — Two-Stage Distribute Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AA. When an artifact has both a debug and a release variant (or analogous dev-vs-prod build types — including this submodule's binary release if it ships separate dev / prod variants), distribute MUST happen in TWO STAGES with operator-confirmed verification between them. Stage 1 distributes the debug / dev variant only; the operator verifies the **distributed** debug variant on the failure-surface device class. Stage 2 distributes the release / prod variant only ONLY AFTER written stage-1 verification, with the §6.Z test-evidence file appended with a `release-stage` section. No combined distribute permitted by default; the combined path requires explicit per-cycle operator authorization recorded in the evidence file. The R8 / minification surprise class on Android (or analogous stripping / production-only optimization classes on other artifacts) is the load-bearing reason. §6.AA-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` default flip + refusal of out-of-order `--release-only` + paired `last-version-{debug,release}` per-channel pre-push check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator directive immediately after the §6.Z forensic-anchor crash on <project>-android-1.2.19-1039: "for purposes like this one we shall distribute via Firebase DEV / DEBUG version only. Once we try it, you continue and once all verified you distribute RELEASE too!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AC — Comprehensive Non-Fatal Telemetry Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AC. Every catch / error / fallback / unexpected-state path on every distributable artifact in this submodule MUST record a non-fatal telemetry event with sufficient context to triage the failure remotely. The Android-side canonical entry is `analytics.recordNonFatal(throwable, ctx)` / `analytics.recordWarning(message, ctx)` (lava.common.analytics.AnalyticsTracker); the Go-side equivalent is `observability.RecordNonFatal(ctx, err, attrs)`. Cancellation throwables are filtered automatically. Mandatory context: feature/module + operation + error_class + error_message (truncated 1024, no credentials per §6.H) + per-platform extras. Forbidden: silent fallbacks without telemetry; credentials/tokens/cookies/PII unredacted in event attributes. §6.AC-debt is open: Detekt + Go-vet rules flagging `try/catch` blocks lacking the telemetry call, pre-push hook integration. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator: "Add comprehensive Crashlytics non-fatals recording all over the apps and API so we can track in the background all warnings, issues and unexpected situations!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.

## CONST-048: Full-Automation-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.25)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that every feature, every functionality, every flow, every use case, every edge case, every service or application, on every platform we support is covered with full automation tests which will confirm anti-bluff policy and provide the proof of fully working capabilities, working implementation as expected, no issues, no bugs, fully documented, tests covered! Nothing less than this does not give us a chance to deliver stable product! This is mandatory constraint which MUST BE respected without ignoring, skipping, slacking or forgetting it!"*

No feature / functionality / flow / use case / edge case / service / application on any supported platform of this submodule is deliverable until covered by automation tests proving six invariants: (1) anti-bluff posture with captured runtime evidence (CONST-035); (2) proof of working capability end-to-end on target topology; (3) implementation matching documented promise; (4) no open issues/bugs surfaced; (5) full documentation in sync; (6) four-layer test floor (pre-build + post-build + runtime + paired mutation).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-048 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule.

## CONST-049: Constitution-Submodule Update Workflow Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.26)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we add something into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD we MUST FIRST fetch and pull all new changes / work from constitution Submodule first! All changes we apply MUST BE commited and pushed to all constitution Submodule upstreams! In case of conflict, IT MUST BE carefully resolved! Nothing can be broken, made faulty, corrupted or unusable! After merging full validation and verification MUST BE done!"*

Before ANY modification to `constitution/{Constitution,CLAUDE,AGENTS}.md` in the parent project, the agent or operator MUST execute the 7-step pipeline: (1) fetch + pull first inside the constitution submodule worktree; (2) apply the change with §11.4.17 classification + verbatim mandate quote; (3) validate (meta-test + no merge-conflict markers + cross-file consistency); (4) commit + push to EVERY configured upstream of the constitution submodule (governance files only — never `git add -A`); (5) careful conflict resolution preserving union of governance content (force-push forbidden per CONST-043 / §9.2); (6) post-merge `git submodule update --remote --init` + re-run cascade verifier (CONST-047); (7) bump consuming project's `.gitmodules` pointer to the new constitution HEAD in the SAME commit as cascade work.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-049 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-049 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.26 for the full mandate.
## CONST-050: No-Fakes-Beyond-Unit-Tests + 100%-Test-Type-Coverage Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.27)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Mocks, stubs, placeholders, TODOs or FIXMEs are allowed to exist ONLY in Unit tests! All other test types MUST interract with real fully implemented System! No fakes, empty implementations or bluffing is allowed of any kind! All codebase of the project MUST BE 100% covered with every supported test type: unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests, full automation tests, security tests, ddos tests, scaling tests, chaos tests, stress tests, performance tests, benchmarking tests, ui tests, ux tests, Challenges (fully incorporating our Challenges Submodule — https://github.com/vasic-digital/Challenges). EVERYTHING MUST BE tested using HelixQA (fully incorporating HelixQA Submodule — https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/HelixQA). HelixQA MUST BE used with all possible written tests suites (test banks) for every applications, service, platform, etc and execution of the full HelixQA QA autonomous sessions! All required dependency Submodules MUST BE added into the project as well (fully recursive!!!)."*

Two cooperating invariants:

**(A) No-fakes-beyond-unit-tests.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholders, `TODO`, `FIXME`, "for now", "in production this would", or empty-implementation patterns are PERMITTED only in unit-test sources. Every other test type — integration, E2E, full automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges, HelixQA — MUST exercise this submodule's real, fully implemented system against real infrastructure. Production code MUST NOT import mock paths.

**(B) 100% test-type coverage.** Codebase MUST be covered by every supported test type the domain warrants: unit, integration, E2E, full-automation, security, DDoS, scaling, chaos, stress, performance, benchmarking, UI, UX, Challenges (vasic-digital/Challenges submodule fully incorporated), HelixQA (HelixDevelopment/HelixQA submodule fully incorporated, with full autonomous QA sessions executing every registered test bank with captured wire evidence).

**Required dependency submodules** (recursive per CONST-047): Challenges + HelixQA + any other functionality submodules under vasic-digital/HelixDevelopment orgs this submodule depends on.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-050 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-050 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.27 for the full mandate.
## CONST-051: Submodules-As-Equal-Codebase + Decoupling + Dependency-Layout Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.28)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"All existing Submodules in the project that we are controlling and belong to some our organizations (vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory - we can ALWAYS check dynamically using GitHub and GitLab CLIs) are equal parts of the project's codebase! We MUST work on that code as much as we do with main project's codebase! All on equal basis! Equally important! ... We MUST NEVER modify Submodules to bring into them any project specific context since they all MUST BE ALWAYS fully decoupled, project not-aware, fully reusable and modular (by any other project(s)), completely testable! All Submodule dependencies that are used by Submodule MUST BE acessed from the root of the project! We MUST NOT have nested Submodule dependencies but accessing each from proper location from the root of the project - directly from project's root project_name/submodule_name or some more proper structure project_name/submodules/submodule_name!"*

Three cooperating invariants apply to every owned-by-us submodule (orgs: vasic-digital, HelixDevelopment, red-elf, ATMOSphere1234321, Bear-Suite, BoatOS123456, Helix-Flow, Helix-Track, Server-Factory, plus any subsequently authorised org — discoverable via `gh org list` / `glab`):

**(A) Equal-codebase.** This submodule is an EQUAL part of every consuming project's codebase. The consuming project's engineering practice — analysis, extension, test creation, gap-filling, bug-fix, documentation (user manuals, guides, diagrams, graphs, SQL definitions, website pages, all materials) — applies to this submodule on equal basis. Coverage ledgers (CONST-048) list this submodule as an in-scope target.

**(B) Decoupling / reusability.** This submodule MUST remain fully decoupled from any specific consuming project. NEVER inject project-specific context (hardcoded paths, hostnames, asset names, naming schemes). Stay project-not-aware, reusable, modular, completely testable as a standalone repository. When parent-project info is needed, use configuration injection (env var, config file, constructor parameter) — never a hardcoded reach.

**(C) Dependency-layout.** Any dependency this submodule consumes MUST be accessible from the consuming project's root at `<root>/<name>/` or `<root>/submodules/<name>/`. **Nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN** — this submodule MUST NOT have its own `.gitmodules` entries pulling in further owned-by-us repos. Third-party submodules are exempt.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-051 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-051 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.28 for the full mandate.
## CONST-052: Lowercase-Snake_Case-Naming Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.29)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"naming convention for Submodules and directories (applied deep into hierarchy recursively) - all directories and Submodules MSUT HAVE lowercase names with space separator between the words of '_' character (snake-case)! All existing Submodules and directories which are not following this rule MUST BE renamed! However, since this will most likely break some of the functionalities renaming we do MUST BE applied to all references to particular Submodule or directory! ... There MUST BE reasonable exceptions for this rules - source code for programming languages or Submodules which apply different naming convention - Android, Java, Kotlin and others. ... Upstreams directory which all of our projects and Submodules have MUST BE renamed to the lowercase letters too, however root project containing the install_upstreams system command (it is exported in out paths in our .bashrc or .zshrc) MUST BE updated to fully work with both Upstreams and upstreams directory. ... NOTE: Rules lowercase / snake-case do apply to all project files as well and references to it and from them!"*

Every directory, submodule, and file in this submodule MUST use lowercase snake_case names. Existing non-compliant names MUST be renamed atomically with updates to every reference (configs, docs, source-code imports, governance files). Reference drift after rename = CONST-052 violation of equal severity to the rename itself.

**Common-sense exceptions (technology-preserving):** language-mandated case for Java/Kotlin/Android/Apple/C#/Swift INSIDE language-roots; vendor/upstream third-party submodules keep upstream names; build artefacts (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `target`, `build`, `bin`) keep tool-mandated names. The test "does renaming break the technology?" trumps the rule.

**`Upstreams/` → `upstreams/` transition:** the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` (exported via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`) supports BOTH directory layouts; lowercase wins when both present.

**Test coverage of renames** (per CONST-050(B)): regression test for reference resolution + full test-type matrix run + anti-bluff wire-evidence captured.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by CONST-052 ID reference) MUST remain in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md, and propagate recursively to any nested owned-by-us submodule. See parent project's `CONSTITUTION.md` §CONST-052 and constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.29 for the full mandate.


## CONST-053: .gitignore + No-Versioned-Build-Artifacts Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.30)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"every project module, every Submodule, every servcie and apolication MUST HAVE proper .gitignore file! We MUST NOT git version build artifacts, cache files, tmp files, main .env file(s) or any files containing sensitive data, API keys or token! Any build derivate which we can recreate by executing proper mechanism for generating MUST NOT be versioned! We MUST pay attention what is going to be commited every time we are preparing to execute commit! If any violetion is detected it MUST be fixed before commit is executed!"*

Every project module, owned-by-us submodule, service, and application MUST ship a proper `.gitignore`. Forbidden-from-version-control classes:

1. **Build artefacts**: `/bin/`, `/build/`, `/dist/`, `/out/`, `target/`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`, `*.a`, `*.o`, `*.class`, `*.pyc`, generator-produced files when the generator is committed.
2. **Cache files**: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.cache/`, `.gradle/`, `.terraform/`, language-server caches.
3. **Temp files**: `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `*~`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`.
4. **Sensitive-data files**: `.env`, `.env.*` (allow `.env.example` placeholder only — no real secrets even as examples), `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `.netrc`, `secrets/`, `api_keys.sh`.
5. **Generated reports/logs**: `*.log`, `coverage.out`, `htmlcov/`, runtime captures unless reference assets.
6. **OS/IDE personal state**: `.idea/`, `.history/`, `.vscode/` (except shared settings).

**Anti-bluff invariant**: `.gitignore` line alone is not sufficient — no file matching the forbidden patterns may be CURRENTLY TRACKED. A tracked `*.log` despite the ignore-line is a violation of equal severity to no ignore-line at all.

**Pre-commit attention**: every commit author (human OR agent) MUST inspect `git diff --staged` + `git status` BEFORE executing the commit. Forbidden-class hits abort the commit until fixed (un-stage, add to `.gitignore`, scrub if already-tracked). Gate `CM-GITIGNORE-PRECOMMIT-AUDIT` + paired mutation.

**Secret-leak intersection (CONST-042 / §11.4.10):** a `.env` leak is BOTH a CONST-053 and a CONST-042 violation; rotation + post-mortem required.

**Recreatable-content test**: if a documented mechanism regenerates the file from sources, it is a build derivative and MUST be ignored. The committed sources MUST include the generator.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-053` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.30 for the full mandate.


## CONST-054: Submodule-Dependency-Manifest Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.31)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"We MUST HAVE mechanism for each Submodule to determine / know what are its Submodule dependencies so new projects or palces we are incorporate them can add these Submodules to the project root and make them available! Suggested idea is configuration file with expected Submodules Git ssh urls perhaps? New project can read it, and recursively add each Submodule to the root of the project and install / expose it to veryone."*

Every owned-by-us submodule MUST ship `helix-deps.yaml` at its root declaring its own-org dependencies. Schema: `schema_version`, `deps: [{name, ssh_url, ref, why, layout: flat|grouped}]`, `transitive_handling.{recursive,conflict_resolution}`, `language_specific_subtree`. Tooling: `incorporate-submodule <ssh-url>` adds the submodule at the parent project's canonical path (CONST-051(C)), reads `helix-deps.yaml`, recurses for each declared dep, aborts on conflicting refs, emits `<root>/.helix-manifest.yaml` audit record.

Anti-bluff guarantee: every manifest paired with a Challenge that bootstraps a throwaway consuming project, runs `incorporate-submodule`, asserts produced layout matches the manifest, runs the submodule's own tests against the bootstrapped layout, captures wire evidence per §11.4.2. A manifest without this proof is a CONST-054 violation.

§11.4.31 / CONST-054 is the **operational complement** of CONST-051(C): nested own-org submodule chains are FORBIDDEN — manifests are the bridge that lets consumers reconstruct the dependency graph at the parent root.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-054` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the dependency-graph layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.31 for the full mandate.

## CONST-055: Post-Constitution-Pull Validation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.32)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every time we fetch and pull new changes on constitution Submodule we MUST process the whole project and all Submodule (deep recursively) for validation and verification taht every single rule or mandatory constraint is followed and respected! If it is not, IT MUST BE!"*

Whenever a project's constitution submodule is fetched + pulled with any content change, the project MUST run `scripts/verify-all-constitution-rules.sh` BEFORE the new constitution HEAD is treated as canonical for any other work. The sweep re-runs the governance-cascade verifier AND every implementable rule gate (CONST-053 `.gitignore` audit, CONST-051(C) nested-own-org-chain audit, CONST-052 case audit, CONST-050(A) mock-from-production audit, CONST-035 anti-bluff smoke, etc.) against the post-pull tree. Failures populate the project's Issues tracker per §11.4.15 (Status: `Reopened`, Type: `Bug`); closure requires positive-evidence per §11.4.

Pull-time invocation: `git submodule update --remote constitution` triggers the sweep automatically (post-update hook OR commit-wrapper invocation). Operator-explicit manual invocation also available.

Anti-bluff: the sweep's own meta-test (paired mutation per §1.1) plants a known violation of each enforced gate and asserts the sweep reports FAIL for the planted gate. A sweep that exits PASS without running every implementable gate is a CONST-055 violation.

CONST-055 is the **enforcement engine** for every other §11.4.x and CONST-NNN rule — without it, new rules cascade as anchors but never get enforced.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-055` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the constitutional-enforcement layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.32 for the full mandate.


## CONST-056: Mandatory install_upstreams on clone/add Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.36)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Every Submodule or Git repository we add or clone MUST BE upstreams installed using Upstreamable utility which MUST BE available through exported paths of the host system (in .bashrc or .zhrc) using install_upstreams command executed from the root of the cloned (added) repository - only if in it is Upstreams or upstreams directory present with bash script files (recipes) for all repository's upstreams!"*

Every clone / add of a Git repository under the consuming project MUST be followed by `install_upstreams` invocation from the repository's root IF its tree contains `upstreams/` (or legacy `Upstreams/` per CONST-052 transition) populated with `*.sh` recipe files. The utility (installed on operator's `PATH` via `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`; implementation in the constitution submodule's `install_upstreams.sh` — already supports BOTH directory names since constitution commit `45d3678`) reads the recipe files, configures every declared upstream as a named git remote, and fans out `origin` push URLs.

Skipping the invocation when `upstreams/` is present silently breaks §2.1 (multi-upstream push is the norm) — the next push lands on only one upstream. Gate `CM-INSTALL-UPSTREAMS-ON-CLONE` + paired mutation. Automation: the future `incorporate-submodule` per CONST-054 auto-invokes; manual invocation supported. Pre-commit check: `git remote -v | grep -c push` reports expected count.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-056` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.36 for the full mandate.


## CONST-057: Type-aware Closure-Status Vocabulary (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.33)

Every project tracking work items by Type per §11.4.16 MUST close them with the Type-appropriate terminal `**Status:**` value, drawn from this 3-element closed map:

| Item `**Type:**` | Closure `**Status:**` value     |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| `Bug`            | `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`            |
| `Feature`        | `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)`      |
| `Task`           | `Completed (→ Fixed.md)`        |

The `(→ Fixed.md)` suffix is preserved across all three so the existing migration-discipline tooling (atomic Issues.md → Fixed.md move per §11.4.19) keeps working without per-Type branching. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh`, `generate_fixed_summary.sh`, the §11.4.23 colorizer) MUST treat the three terminal values as semantically equivalent (all "closed, positive evidence captured") while preserving the literal in the emitted document.

Closing a `Feature` with `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` or a `Task` with `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` is a CONST-057 violation. Gate `CM-CLOSURE-VOCAB-TYPE-AWARE` walks every Fixed.md heading + every Issues.md heading whose `**Status:**` is one of the three terminal values and asserts the Status-Type match. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.23.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-057` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.33 for the full mandate.

## CONST-058: Reopened-Source Attribution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.34)

Every Issues.md (or equivalent project tracker) heading whose `**Status:**` is `Reopened` MUST carry, within 8 non-blank lines of the heading, a `**Reopened-Details:**` line capturing four sub-facts:

- **By:** `AI` or `User` (source-of-truth observer who flipped the status). `AI` covers in-loop reopens (test failure, gate regression, captured-evidence retrospect). `User` covers operator-side observations (manual testing, end-user report, design reconsideration).
- **On:** ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Reason:** one-line cause classification — chosen from the closed vocabulary `{ test-failed | manual-testing-detected | captured-evidence-contradicts | end-user-report | cycle-re-discovered | design-reconsidered }`. Other values permitted with explicit `Reason: <free text>` annotation but the closed list MUST be tried first.
- **Evidence:** path to or short description of the captured artefact justifying the reopen — log file, recording, gate failure ID, operator quote, etc. Reopens without evidence are §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 violations (demotion from Fixed requires captured evidence under the conditions that re-exposed the defect).

The Issues_Summary.md Status column MUST distinguish the four `Reopened` sub-states by source so a sweep query for "reopens by AI in the last 30 days" is mechanically possible. Suggested column rendering: `Reopened (AI: test-failed)` vs `Reopened (User: manual-testing)`. Gate `CM-ITEM-REOPENED-DETAILS` mirrors `CM-ITEM-OPERATOR-BLOCKED-DETAILS` (§11.4.21 walk pattern). Composes with §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.15 / §11.4.21.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-058` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.34 for the full mandate.

## CONST-059: Canonical-Root Inheritance Clarity (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.35)

The **constitution submodule's** three files (`constitution/Constitution.md`, `constitution/CLAUDE.md`, `constitution/AGENTS.md`) ARE the **canonical root** (also called the **parent** files). They contain only universal rules per §11.4.17.

The consuming project's **repository-root files** (`<project-root>/CLAUDE.md`, `<project-root>/AGENTS.md`, optionally `<project-root>/Constitution.md`) are **consumer extensions**. They MUST start with the inheritance pointer (either the Claude-Code native `@constitution/CLAUDE.md` import or the portable `## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md` heading). They contain only project-specific rules per §11.4.17.

**When in doubt about which file to edit:** universal rule → constitution submodule's file; project-specific rule → consumer's file. Default consumer-side when uncertain (§11.4.17 — narrower scope is cheap to widen).

**Terminology:** "the parent CLAUDE.md" / "the root Constitution" → constitution-submodule file at `constitution/<filename>`; "the project CLAUDE.md" / "this project's AGENTS.md" → consumer-side file at `<project-root>/<filename>`.

**No silent demotion or silent promotion.** Moving a rule between layers MUST be a visible commit — `git mv` of a section if it's a clean clone, or explicit `Lifted from <project> to constitution per §11.4.35` / `Demoted from constitution to <project> per §11.4.35` commit-message annotation.

Gate `CM-CANONICAL-ROOT-CLARITY` verifies (a) consumer's `CLAUDE.md` opens with the inheritance pointer, (b) constitution submodule's three files are present at the expected path, (c) no `## INHERITED FROM` block in the constitution submodule's own files (those ARE the source-of-truth, not consumers). Composes with §11.4.17.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-059` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.35 for the full mandate.

## CONST-060: Fetch-before-edit Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.37)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-15): *"Make sure that feedback_fetch_before_edit memory rule is part of our constitution Submodule - the root Consitution, AGENTS.MD and CLAUDE.MD. Validate and verify that Proejct-Toolkit and all Submodules do inherit all of them! Follow the constitution Submodule documentation for details."*

The FIRST git-touching action of every session, on every consuming project (owned or third-party), MUST be:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git log --oneline HEAD..@{u}
git submodule foreach --recursive 'git fetch --all --prune --quiet'
```

If `HEAD..@{u}` is non-empty, integrate the upstream changes BEFORE any local edit. Acting on stale local state produces three failure modes documented in the originating §11.4.37 incident (multi-agent / parallel-session work): (1) **redundant work** — the agent re-does what a parallel session already finished, (2) **false confidence** — completion reports for already-done work, (3) **divergent history** — duplicate sibling commits that double the conflict surface on next push.

**Anti-bluff invariant**: the fetch+log check MUST produce captured evidence — the actual `HEAD..@{u}` output, even if empty. Skipping the check on the basis of "I just fetched" or "nothing could have changed in the last N minutes" is a §11.4.6 (no-guessing) violation: the remote state is not knowable without a fetch.

**Cascade requirement**: This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-060` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to §11.4 PASS-bluff at the parallel-session-coordination layer. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.37 for the full mandate.


## CONST-062 — CONST-078: Round-191 cascade — anchors §11.4.42 through §11.4.58

The following anchors propagate from constitution submodule §11.4.42-58 (User mandates 2026-05-17 / 2026-05-18 / 2026-05-19) into this submodule's governance via short-form reference per CONST-049 step 6. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the respective enforcement layer. Cascade requirement: this block (verbatim or by ID reference) MUST appear in this submodule's CONSTITUTION.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and propagate to any nested owned-by-us submodule.

- **CONST-062 / §11.4.42 — Iteration-discipline mandate.** Each fix cycle MUST run pre-build gate + post-build/post-flash test + paired §1.1 mutation + post-validation §11.4.40 retest. Truncating cycle to ship faster = violation. Subagents default to this path.
- **CONST-063 / §11.4.43 — TDD-Fix-Discipline.** Every bug fix starts with a failing RED test reproducing the defect on the target topology. Fix lands only after RED → GREEN against real infrastructure. Skipping RED step = violation.
- **CONST-064 / §11.4.44 — Document Revision Header.** Every governance/status/plan doc MUST carry `**Revision:** N` + `**Last modified:** YYYY-MM-DD` + `**Maintainer:**` directly below H1; bumped per content edit. Missing/stale header = violation.
- **CONST-065 / §11.4.45 — Integration-Status-Doc Maintenance.** Every `Status.md` (integration, programme, sub-system) carries the §11.4.44 header and stays in sync with actual programme state at every commit advancing state. Out-of-sync = violation (CONST-044 severity).
- **CONST-066 / §11.4.46 — Validate-recent-work before post-flash sweep.** Each recent-work item since previous sweep MUST have its §11.4.43 RED test run against the live device and report GREEN before post-flash full-test sweeps. Skipping = violation.
- **CONST-067 / §11.4.47 — Firebase Data Review.** Every Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics finding triaged per §11.4.47 severity table, deduped against Issues.md; new stacktrace gets §11.4.43 RED test before fix. Untriaged past SLA = violation.
- **CONST-068 / §11.4.48 — UI-Driven Video Testing.** Every supported app/service ships UI-driven traversal tests covering surfaces A-E; each run captures screen-recording as anti-bluff evidence. Missing driver or missing video = violation.
- **CONST-069 / §11.4.49 — Dual-Approach Testing.** Every feature test ships in BOTH UI-driven (uiautomator) AND Intent-driven (programmatic API) variants. Both RED until fix lands, then both GREEN. Single-variant = violation.
- **CONST-070 / §11.4.50 — Deterministic Consistency.** Every test runs N iterations with consistent results; flaky tests forbidden; intermittent FAIL must be diagnosed not retried. First-PASS-only reporting = violation.
- **CONST-071 / §11.4.51 — Live-ADB-First Maximization.** Prefer live-ADB probes over post-flash sweeps wherever the fix surface allows (§11.4.43 step 2 maximised). Skipping live-probe when feasible = violation.
- **CONST-072 / §11.4.52 — Autonomous-Validation.** Every test/feature/flow MUST have an autonomous execution path (instrumentation APK / headless driver) so subagent flows run unattended. Operator-attended-only = violation.
- **CONST-073 / §11.4.53 — Fixed_Summary parity.** `Fixed_Summary.md` (+ HTML/PDF exports per §11.4.12/§11.4.44) regenerated on every Issues.md → Fixed.md migration. Stale exports = violation. HTML+PDF travel together with the `.md`.
- **CONST-074 / §11.4.54 — ATM-NNN ticket identifier.** Every Issue/Feature/Task entry carries an `ATM-NNN` id (zero-padded, monotonically increasing per project); cross-references in governance/plans/changelogs use the ATM-NNN id. Missing/duplicate = violation.
- **CONST-075 / §11.4.55 — Reopens-history + per-item Reopens.md.** Every Reopened item gets `docs/reopens/ATM-NNN.md` tracking each cycle (date, source AI/User, reason from CONST-058 vocabulary, evidence path). `Reopens_Summary.md` regenerated on every reopen. Missing per-item doc = violation.
- **CONST-076 / §11.4.56 — Status_Summary parity + two-audience format.** `Status_Summary.md` (+ HTML/PDF exports) ships in operator-side + AI-side sections and stays in parity with underlying status docs at every commit advancing state. Drift/missing audience section = violation.
- **CONST-077 / §11.4.57 — README.md doc-link section + revision metadata.** Every `README.md` carries (a) §11.4.44 revision header below H1, (b) Documentation link section listing canonical governance + status + plan docs. Missing section or stale links = violation.
- **CONST-078 / §11.4.58 — Parallel-development methodology (PWU).** Project work proceeds through the Parallel Work Unit pipeline: Stage 1 DEVELOP (parallel, isolated worktrees) → Stage 2 MERGE (serial flock + §11.4.41 4-step) → Stage 3 REBUILD+FLASH → Stage 4 VALIDATE (parallel) → Stage 5 SWEEP. Four-layer lock hierarchy: L1 flock / L2 git / L3 contention-path advisory / L4 per-PWU worktree. Disjoint-scope PWUs run fully parallel; cross-scope overlap rejected to rebase. Conductor REFUSES merge of any PWU lacking captured evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.52.

## Round-207 cascade — §11.4.59 + §11.4.60 (README always-sync + Documentation always-sync composite covenant)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-19): *"fully review and update our main README document. ... Make sure main README is among documents we MUST ALWAYS keep updated and in Sync with the projects and other documentation! Make sure we always export it (on every update) into PDF and HTML."* AND (2026-05-19 ~09:00Z): *"Double check if all documents are properly tied with our root Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD so they are always up to date, always in sync and exported into PDF and HTML! ... Issues, Issues_Summary, Fixed, Fixed_Summary, Continuation, Status and Status_Summary for all contexts (areas) — THEY ALL MUST BE REGULARLY UPDATED, IN SYNC AND CONSISTENT without giving at any moment false picture about the state of the project or particular area(s) of it!"*

- **§11.4.59 — README always-sync mandate.** `README.md` at the project root is a §11.4.12-class always-sync document: kept current with every doc/integration/Status.md change, lockstep with `docs/CONTINUATION.md`, exported to `.html` + `.pdf` on every update via `scripts/testing/sync_readme_export.sh` (auto-invoked by `sync_issues_docs.sh`), carrying §11.4.44 revision header + Documentation Map section linking every Status / Status_Summary / spec / plan / guide / script-companion / changelog + the constitution submodule + per-audience navigation. Pre-build gate `CM-README-EXPORT-SYNC` enforces mtime parity (README.html + README.pdf ≥ README.md). Paired mutation backdates HTML+PDF → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-readme-sync`, `--no-readme-export`, `--readme-stale-OK` flag.
- **§11.4.60 — Documentation always-sync composite covenant.** Eight doc classes (Issues, Issues_Summary, Fixed, Fixed_Summary, CONTINUATION, README, every Status.md, every Status_Summary.md) MUST be in sync at all times across `.md` + `.html` + `.pdf` artefacts. Per-class anchors §11.4.12 / §11.4.44 / §11.4.45 / §11.4.53 / §11.4.56 / §11.4.57 / §11.4.59 / §12.10 govern individually; §11.4.60 binds them via single composite gate `CM-DOCS-COMPOSITE-SYNC` that FAILs the build if ANY instance's `.html` or `.pdf` mtime is older than `.md` mtime. Walks `docs/` recursively for Status fleet. Paired mutation backdates `docs/Issues.html` → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-composite-doc-sync`, `--allow-stale-html`, `--summary-not-applicable` flag exists.

**Cascade requirement:** These anchors (verbatim or by `§11.4.59` / `§11.4.60` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.59 + §11.4.60 for the full mandates.

## CONST-068: Shell-script target-shell-parseability mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.67)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-19): *"any issue we spot must be fixed, bash scripts as well if they are broken!"* + *"Make sure that this is mandatory rule!"*

> Verbatim 2026-05-19 operator mandate: *"all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner - they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected! We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completition and full usability by end users of the product!"*

Every committed shell script MUST be parseable by its target interpreter (`sh -n` for `/bin/sh`, `bash -n` for `/bin/bash`, etc.) AND MUST declare a shebang matching its actual syntax usage. Bash-only constructs (`>(...)`, `<(...)`, `[[ ]]`, `<<<`, arrays, `${var^^}`, etc.) used in scripts that may be invoked via `sh script.sh` MUST be wrapped in `eval` so the parser sees only a string (target shells like mksh parse the entire script before executing — runtime guards cannot save a parse-time rejection). Honest shebangs only: `#!/bin/bash` only if bash actually expected; `#!/bin/sh` requires POSIX-clean body. Fix at source per §11.4.1, never at callsites. Composes with §11.4.1 / §11.4.4 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.51. Pre-build gate `CM-SCRIPT-TARGET-SHELL-PARSEABLE` runs `sh -n` on every in-scope script. No escape hatch — no `--skip-parseability-check`, `--bash-only-script`, `--runtime-guard-suffices` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `CONST-068` ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. See constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.67 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.68 — Positive Sink-Side / Downstream Evidence Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.68)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We still do not hear any audio played from D3 device! Arvus Web Dashboard when we play music from D3 shows nothing for Codec In Use! This MUST BE investigated and fixed! How come we passed the tests with Arvus validation? What were values for the Codec In Use field? Empty means nothing! This is not working! It MUST BE FIXED, TESTED AND VERIFIED WITH FULL AUTOMATION TESTING ASAP!!!"*

A test that asserts audio or video routing PASS MUST capture and verify **positive sink-side or downstream evidence** — never config-only, never metadata-only, never PCM-open-state-only. At least one of the closed enumeration MUST be captured for every audio/video routing PASS: (1) sink-side codec-state with non-empty Codec-In-Use matching the expected codec regex; (2) strictly-positive PCM frames-written delta from `/proc/asound/.../status hw_ptr`; (3) ALSA ELD/EDID-Like-Data showing negotiated channel count + format; (4) ffprobe-on-captured-mp4 with non-zero frame count + expected codec/resolution/fps; (5) recording-analyzer event match per §11.4.2/§11.4.5; (6) tinycap RMS amplitude above the line-level floor. Empty / `<unreachable>` / `<N.E.>` / `<None>` placeholders are NOT positive evidence; a missing-but-required sink is `OPERATOR-BLOCKED` (release-blocker), never SKIP, never PASS. No escape hatch — no `--skip-sink-evidence`, `--allow-empty-codec`, `--sink-unreachable-is-pass`, `--metadata-only-suffices` flag exists.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.68` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the sink-side-evidence layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.68 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.70 — Subagent-Driven Execution Is The Default (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.70)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Always do if possible Subagent-driven! Add this into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md. This should be the default choice ALWAYS!"*

When executing implementation plans (or any task-decomposed execution flow), the **default execution model is subagent-driven** per `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Inline execution is permitted ONLY when (a) the task is trivial AND fits a single sub-300-line edit, OR (b) the operator explicitly requests inline at brainstorm-handoff time. Subagent-driven is the default because it gives isolated context per task, naturally enforces two-stage review, is parallel-PWU compatible (§11.4.58), creates an anti-bluff seam (§11.4), and survives operator absence. No escape hatch — `--inline-execution-required`, `--no-subagents`, `--monolithic-execution` are NOT permitted flags. Skipping subagent-driven for non-trivial work without recorded operator authorisation is itself a §11.4 PASS-bluff.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.70` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the execution-model layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.70 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.71 — Pre-Push Fetch + Investigate + Integrate Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.71)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"before pushing changes to any upstream for any repository - main repo or Submodule, we MUST fetch and pull all changes. Once these are obtained WE MUST investigate what is different compared to head position we were on last time before fetching and pulling new changes! We MUST understand what is done and for what purpose, easpecially how that does affect our project and our System in general! Any mandatory changes or improvements required by fresh changes we just have brough in MUST BE incorporated, covered with all supported types of the tests which will produce as a result of its success execution REAL PROOFS of working for all componetns and functionalities covered and work fully in anti-bluff manner!"*

The everyday-push variant of §11.4.41. EVERY push (every repository — main + every submodule) MUST follow the 5-step cycle: (1) fetch all remotes (`git fetch --all --prune --tags`, capture stdout); (2) pull all upstream branches whose tip differs, resolving conflicts per consumer judgment (never auto-`--ours`/`--theirs`); (3) investigate the diff vs OUR previous HEAD — read EVERY foreign commit's body, understand what/why/how-it-affects-our-system; (4) integrate mandatory changes with §11.4.4(b) four-layer coverage + §11.4.43 TDD-fix discipline, every PASS carrying §11.4.5 captured-evidence (REAL PROOFS, not metadata-only); (5) only then push, verifying with `git ls-remote` post-push. No escape hatch — no `--skip-fetch`, `--no-investigate`, `--fast-push`, `--trust-upstream` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.71` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the push-discipline layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.71 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.72 — Audio Top-Priority Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.72)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Make sure all fixes for audio are always top priority in main working stream!"*

The conductor (main working stream — Claude Code session, AI agent, or human operator) MUST treat audio fixes as the highest-priority class on the serial dispatch queue. Any time the conductor faces a choice between dispatching an audio task vs a non-audio task on the SAME serial resource, the audio task wins. Parallel BACKGROUND subagents (research, refactors, infrastructure documentation) MAY run concurrently with audio work but do NOT preempt audio on the main-stream serial dispatch queue. No escape hatch — there is no "but this non-audio task is faster" or "but this research is more interesting" override; audio-stack regressions are user-perceptible and high-impact while research and refactors can wait.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.72` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a process violation at the dispatch-priority layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.72 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.73 — Main-Specification Document Versioning + Revision Discipline (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.73)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Make sure everything we add now in previous and upcoming requests IS ALWAYS applied to the main specification — if we have one. Since all these are not major changes we could increase Specification version per change for secondary version instead of the primary. Primary version MUST BE increased for much bigger levels of changes! Add this into root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md as mandatory rule / constraint applicable ONLY IF we have something like the main specification document or we do recognize something like the main specification document. Document MUST BE updated ALWAYS to follow the versioning rules we are appling here + revision and other properties we have!"*

Applies **only when a project recognises a main specification document**. When it does: (1) every additive operator requirement, refinement, or accepted recommendation MUST be applied to the spec before or as part of the implementing work; (2) spec versioning has two axes — *primary* (V1/V2/V3, bumped for major rewrites by explicit operator decision, old versions archived) and *secondary* (the §11.4.61 metadata-table `Revision` integer, bumped for every other change); (3) the metadata table MUST stay current (`Revision`, `Last modified`, `Status summary`, `Fixed`); (4) propagated copies of the rule MUST reference the active `specification.V<primary>.md`, not a stale archive; (5) on primary bump the old file moves to `<spec-dir>/archive/` with `Status: superseded`. Classification: universal, applicable conditionally per the scope condition.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.73` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a release blocker when a project has a main spec and lets it drift.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.73 for the full mandate.


## §11.4.74 — Submodule-Catalogue-First Discovery + Extend-Don't-Reimplement (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.74)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We MUST ALWAYS check which already developed features / functionalities do exist as a part of our comprehensive Submodules catalogue located in vasic-digital and HelixDevelopment organizations on GitHub and GitLab both! Project MUST BE aware of all its existence so we do not implement same things multiple times if they are already done as some of existing universal, reusable general development purpose Submodules! For any missing features that some Submodules we incorporate may be missing we MUST IMPLEMENT the properly and extend those Submodules furter! We do control all of the and we CAN and MUST maintain and extend the regularly! All development cycle rules we have MUST BE applied to them and fully respected!"*

Before scaffolding ANY new module, package, helper, or utility, the contributor (human or AI agent) MUST: (1) survey the canonical Submodule catalogue — `vasic-digital` and `HelixDevelopment` on both GitHub AND GitLab; (2) inventory existing Submodules; (3) reuse before reimplement — if a Submodule provides the functionality (or 80%+ of it), add it as a Git submodule rather than write fresh; (4) extend in-place when 80%+ matches but features are missing — add the missing features TO THAT SUBMODULE (PR upstream + bump pointer), never as a duplicating consuming-project helper; (5) apply all development-cycle rules to those Submodules; (6) document the survey result in the feature's tracker entry with a `Catalogue-Check:` field (`reuse <org/repo>@<sha>` / `extend <org/repo>@<sha>` / `no-match <date>`). Classification: universal.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.74` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Severity-equivalent to a process violation; duplicate implementations landed without catalogue check are release blockers.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.74 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.78 — CodeGraph code-intelligence mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule)

Inherited from `constitution/Constitution.md` §11.4.78. Every project worked on by AI coding agents — and every owned submodule when developed standalone — MUST install, initialize, and use **CodeGraph** (`https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph`, npm package `@colbymchenry/codegraph`): a local SQLite semantic code-knowledge-graph exposed to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol (MCP), 100% local with no cloud or external API. Install globally via npm (no `sudo` — the npm prefix MUST be user-writable). Run `codegraph init` + `codegraph index`: `.codegraph/config.json` is tracked; `.codegraph/codegraph.db` is gitignored with `codegraph index` as its §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism; the `config.json` `exclude` list MUST exclude other-owned submodules and — non-negotiably — every §11.4.10 credential/secret path. Wire the `codegraph serve --mcp` MCP server into every CLI agent the developers use (Claude Code `.mcp.json`, OpenCode `opencode.json`, Qwen Code `.qwen/settings.json`, Crush `.crush.json`, Kimi CLI `~/.kimi/mcp.json`); every config references the bare `codegraph` command on `PATH`. Cover the integration with an anti-bluff verification suite whose per-agent end-to-end layer uses an unforgeable challenge (a fact obtainable only by calling a CodeGraph MCP tool); un-runnable agents are documented SKIP gaps per §11.4.3, never faked PASSes. Document everything in `docs/CODEGRAPH.md`.

**Cascade requirement:** this anchor (verbatim or by §11.4.78 ID reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `QWEN.md`. See the constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.78 for the full mandate. Non-compliance is a process violation.

## §11.4.69 — Universal Sink-Side Positive-Evidence Taxonomy + Mechanical Enforcement (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.69)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"THIS MUST HAPPEN NEVER AGAIN!!! We MUST HAVE this all working! Not just for audio but for every single piece of the System!!! Proper full automation when executed with success MUST MEAN that manual testing will be as much positive at least regarding the success results! ... Solution MUST BE universal, generic that solves working flows for all System components and for all future and all existing projects! ... Everything we do MUST BE validated and verified with rock-solid proofs and anti-bluff policy enforcement and fulfillment!"*

Universal generalisation of §11.4.68 (audio-specific) across every user-visible feature class. Every user-visible feature MUST map to one entry in the closed-set §11.4.69 sink-side evidence taxonomy (`audio_output`, `audio_input`, `video_display`, `network_throughput`, `network_connectivity`, `bluetooth_a2dp`, `bluetooth_pair`, `touch_input`, `sensor`, `gpu_render`, `storage_read`, `storage_write`, `mediacodec_decode`, `mediacodec_encode`, `miracast`, `cast`, `boot_service`, `package_install`, `permission_grant`, `wifi_link`, `wifi_throughput`, `ethernet_link`, `display_topology`, `drm_playback`, `subtitle_render` — open to additions, never contraction). Every PASS for a feature in the taxonomy MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path matching the required evidence shape. New helper contracts (additive during grace, mandatory after 2026-06-19): `ab_pass_with_evidence <description> <evidence_path>` (verifies path exists + non-empty), `ab_skip_with_reason <description> <closed-set-reason>` (reasons: `geo_restricted`, `operator_attended`, `hardware_not_present`, `topology_unsupported`, `network_unreachable_external`, `feature_disabled_by_config`; forbids `network_unreachable_external` for any taxonomy feature with a sink-side probe); bare `ab_pass` deprecated (WARN pre-grace, FAIL post-grace). Three pre-build gates + paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-SINK-EVIDENCE-PER-FEATURE`, `CM-NO-FAIL-OPEN-SKIP`, `CM-AB-PASS-WITH-EVIDENCE-EVERYWHERE`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-evidence`, `--config-only-pass`, `--allow-fail-open-skip`, `--legacy-ab-pass-permitted` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.69` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-69-PROPAGATION` enforces the anchor literal across the consumer fleet; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the sink-side-evidence layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.69 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.75 — Mechanical Enforcement Without Exception (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.75)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Why do these violations still happen!? This is a serious problem! We cannot rely on stability nor consistency if we cannot respect our Constitution, mandatory rules and constraints! Is there a way to make this always respected, followed and applied without exception fully and unconditionally!? WE MUST HAVE THIS WORKING FLAWLESSLY!!! Do investigate the root causes of such problems! Once all problems are identified WE MUST apply proper mechanisms for this not to happen NEVER EVER AGAIN!"*

The §11.4 covenant historically relied on agent + operator vigilance; three 2026-05-19→20 forensic incidents proved that late-binding enforcement fires hours-to-days after the violator commit reaches every remote. §11.4.75 closes the gap with FIVE independent mechanical enforcement layers — bypassing any single layer does not bypass the discipline: (1) local `pre-commit` git hook (refuses staged `.md` lacking sibling `.html`+`.pdf`); (2) `commit_all.sh` integration (`_constitution_sibling_check` + auto-`sync_all_markdown_exports.sh` self-repair); (3) local `pre-push` git hook (re-runs siblings + propagation-gate subset); (4) `post-commit` auto-repair hook (auto-generates orphan-`.md` siblings, idempotent + recursion-guarded); (5) local-only final-gate ritual (remote CI DISABLED per User mandate — operator runs `pre_build_verification.sh` + meta-test before every tag per §11.4.40). Helper contracts: `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`, `scripts/git_hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,post-commit,commit-msg}`, `_constitution_sibling_check`. The `commit-msg` hook enforces a `Bypass-rationale: <reason>` footer when `--no-verify` is detected; `docs/audit/bypass_events.md` accumulates the audit trail. Five gates with paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-INSTALL-SCRIPT`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-SOURCE-DIR`, `CM-COMMIT-ALL-SIBLING-CHECK`, `CM-CI-WORKFLOW-PRESENT`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-hooks`, `--bypass-enforcement`, `--allow-orphan-md`, `--ci-not-applicable`, `--mechanical-enforcement-not-needed` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.75` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the enforcement layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.75 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.76 — Containers-Submodule Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.76)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"For any work or requirements of running services or codebase inside the Containers (Docker / Podman / Qemy / Emulators, and so on) we MUST USE / INCORPORATE the Containers Submodule properly: https://github.com/vasic-digital/containers (git@github.com:vasic-digital/containers.git). Containers Submodule contains all means for us to Containerize our code and services! If any feature or Containing System is missing or not supported we MUST EXTEND IT properly like we do all of our projects! No bluff work is allowed of any kind!"*

For ANY containerized workload (Docker / Podman / Qemu / Kubernetes / container-backed emulators), every consuming project MUST: (1) install `vasic-digital/containers` (`digital.vasic.containers`) as a Git submodule; (2) consume via `replace` directive during development + pinned commit SHAs in production; (3) boot infra on-demand via `pkg/boot` + `pkg/compose` + `pkg/health` so operators are never required to start `podman machine` / `docker compose up` manually — the boot is part of the test entry point (the on-demand-infra invariant); (4) extend the Submodule (PR upstream) for missing runtimes / lifecycle primitives — never reimplement in-project (per §11.4.74); (5) anti-bluff: integration tests claiming to exercise containerized components MUST actually boot them via the Submodule — short-circuit fakes that bypass boot are a §11.4 violation. Tracker rows touching containerization MUST record `Catalogue-Check: extend vasic-digital/containers@<sha>` (or `reuse`). Planned gate `CM-CONTAINERS-USED` scans container-touching PRs for `digital.vasic.containers/...` imports; paired mutation strips the import + asserts FAIL.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.76` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-76-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.77 — Regeneration-Mechanism-Required Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.77)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We must be sure that after excluding anything from Git versioning we still have the mechanism which will out of the box obtain or re-generate missing content!"*

Every `.gitignore` entry excluding (a) >~100 MiB OR (b) any artefact essential to building / running / testing the project MUST carry a documented + automated mechanism to either re-obtain (download from authoritative source: vendor tarball, SDK installer, npm/pip/cargo/go-mod/container registry, dedicated git submodule, S3/GCS) OR re-generate (run from tracked source via build pipeline, code-gen, asset render, captured-evidence replay, container build). Required artefacts per qualifying entry: (1) `.gitignore-meta/<entry-slug>.yaml` declaring pattern + mechanism-type + script-path + expected-disk-usage + vendor-url-or-source + integrity hash + requires-network + requires-credentials; (2) a non-interactive entry in `scripts/setup.sh` post-clone bootstrap; (3) a pre-build gate verifying regenerated content present OR a recent `.gitignore-meta/.regenerated/<slug>.ok` stamp; (4) README + `docs/guides/*.md` describing the mechanism + manual fallback + time/disk budget + §11.4.10 credentials. Bare `.gitignore` additions without the mechanism are a §11.4 PASS-bluff variant — codebase appears complete but a fresh clone cannot build/run. No escape hatch — no `--skip-regen-mechanism`, `--gitignore-is-enough`, `--operator-already-has-content` flag. Planned gate `CM-GITIGNORE-REGEN-MECHANISM` + paired §1.1 mutation (strip a required YAML key → gate FAILs).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.77` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-77-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer.

## §11.4.79 — Own-Org Submodules MUST Be Included in the CodeGraph Index (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.79)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"All Submodules we use in the project and that are part of organizations to which we have the full access via GitHub, GitLab and other CLIs MUST BE included into the codegraph database and initialized / scanned / synced!"*

Refines §11.4.78's exclude-list with a per-submodule-ownership split: (a) own-org submodules (full write access via the project's CLIs — canonical orgs `vasic-digital` + `HelixDevelopment`) MUST be INCLUDED in the index; (b) third-party submodules (the §11.4.74 `no-match → vendor` path) MUST be EXCLUDED. Operational steps: (1) `git submodule update --remote --merge` to pull latest before re-indexing, respecting load-bearing pins on third-party submodules; (2) adjust `.codegraph/config.json` exclude list to keep own-org paths in scope; (3) re-index via `scripts/codegraph_setup.sh`; (4) verify via `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh` with ≥1 probe resolving a symbol living ONLY inside an own-org submodule; (5) paired §1.1 mutation — temporarily add the own-org submodule to exclude → validate MUST FAIL on the cross-submodule probe → restore. An index that lies about reachable symbols is a PASS-bluff against AI agents. Own-org submodules silently excluded without an audit trail in `.codegraph/config.json` comments is a release blocker.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.79` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-79-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.80 — CodeGraph Regular-Update + Sync Automation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.80)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"We MUST regularly check for the updates and execute codegraph npm updates so the latest version of it is always installed on the host machine! ... Make sure we have proper full automation bash scripts which will run regularly and that these are part of the constitution Submodule ... Make sure all updates, sync processes we do and important codegraph related events are all documented under docs/codegraph in Status and Status_Summary documents ... and regularly export them like all other Status docs into the PDF and HTML!"*

Three deliverables (all living in the constitution submodule, inherited by reference per §3 — consuming projects invoke at `${CONST_DIR}/scripts/codegraph_*.sh`, never copy): (1) `scripts/codegraph_update.sh` — npm-installs latest `@colbymchenry/codegraph` after a registry version check; appends old/new version to `docs/codegraph/Status.md`; anti-bluff verifies `codegraph --version` reflects the new version after install (npm exit 0 ≠ working binary). (2) `scripts/codegraph_sync.sh` — after a successful update runs `codegraph status` → `codegraph sync .` → `codegraph status` → the project's `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh`; appends every step's output to BOTH the project's and the constitution's `docs/codegraph/Status.md`. (3) `docs/codegraph/Status.md` + `Status_Summary.md` append-only ledgers, exported to `.html` + `.pdf` per §11.4.65. Cadence: weekly floor (per §11.4.45). A consuming project that has not run `codegraph_update.sh` in >2 weeks AND has open AI-agent work is a release blocker. Paired §1.1 mutation: downgrade installed version → script detects drift → restore.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.80` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-80-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.81 — Cross-Platform-Parity Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.81)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"Any Linux-only blocker / issue we have MUST BE created macOS and other supported platforms equivalent! So, depending on platform proper implementation will be used for particular OS! EVERYTHING MUST BE PROPERLY EXTENDED AND UPDATED!"*

Every consuming project whose supported-platforms manifest lists more than one OS MUST, for every feature/test/gate/challenge/mutation depending on platform-specific primitives, ship a per-OS-equivalent implementation chosen at runtime via `uname -s` (or equivalent detection). Three sub-mandates: **(A) Per-OS implementation REQUIRED** — Linux cgroup/systemd/`/proc` primitives MUST have documented per-OS equivalents (POSIX `setrlimit`/`ulimit`, macOS `launchd`, BSD `rctl`, Windows Job Object) chosen via runtime dispatch. **(B) Per-OS tests REQUIRED** — every platform-dependent gate test MUST have `case "$(uname -s)" in` branches with positive captured evidence per §11.4.2 + §11.4.5 in each branch; SKIP-with-reason acceptable ONLY when the platform genuinely cannot enforce the invariant. **(C) Honest kernel-gap citation + adjacent equivalent test REQUIRED** — where a Linux primitive has NO equivalent due to a documented kernel limitation (canonical: XNU does not enforce `RLIMIT_AS` for unprivileged processes), the test MUST detect the gap at runtime, SKIP with exact kernel reason + reproducer + honest-gap-doc link, AND provide an ADJACENT test exercising the closest invariant the platform CAN enforce (e.g. `RLIMIT_CPU`+`SIGXCPU` as the macOS proxy), itself anti-bluff with a paired §1.1 mutation. Gate `CM-CROSS-PLATFORM-PARITY` scans for `case "$(uname -s)"` blocks asserting a non-SKIP branch (or honest-gap citation) per platform in the manifest; paired mutation strips a Darwin branch → gate FAILs. No escape hatch.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.81` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-81-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker on multi-platform projects.

## §11.4.82 — Iteration-Speedup Discipline Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.82)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"How can we speed-up this whole development and fixing process? ... Do not forget to all speed optimizations critical rules and mandatory constraints MUST BE all added into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and QWEN.md and all other relevant constitution Submodules files!"*

Iteration cycle time is a first-order quality enabler. Every consuming project's build / test / commit / debug pipeline MUST adopt these speedup disciplines AS MANDATORY (each independently enforceable): (A) Phase-1 forensic (`superpowers:systematic-debugging`) before any speculative source patch — speculative patches without FACT-grade root cause are §11.4.6 + §11.4.82 violations; (B) Live-ADB-First (or live-equivalent) before any rebuild — strengthens §11.4.51 to a release-blocker mandate; (C) 30-second pre-flight before launching rebuild orchestrators (device/sink reachability, host memory/disk, no stale locks, no orphan processes); (D) persistent build caches outside containers (`ccache`/`sccache`/Gradle daemon bind-mounted to host); (E) module-only rebuild for loadable-module-only changes; (F) parallel multi-device testing with separate `qa-results/<TS>/<device-tag>/` outputs; (G) subagent scope discipline + worktree isolation (≤30 min budget, single-responsibility, `isolation: "worktree"` default); (H) lock-file + stale-process hygiene (clean `.git/index.lock`, disable auto git-gc in concurrent repos); (I) cycle telemetry per §11.4.24 (commit hash, per-phase wall-clock, speedup-flag set, outcome — aggregated weekly). Gate `CM-ITERATION-SPEEDUP-DISCIPLINE` audits recent cycles for telemetry citing which of (A)-(I) applied; paired §1.1 mutation strips the speedup-flag column → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-phase1-forensic`, `--no-pre-flight`, `--rebuild-everything-always`, `--unlimited-subagent-scope`, `--ignore-locks`, `--no-telemetry` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.82` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-82-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.83 — docs/qa/ End-User Evidence Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.83)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded e2e communication transcript + any attached materials under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` (per-feature subdirectories). A feature with no QA transcript is itself a §107 PASS-bluff — it claims to work but has no auditable runtime evidence. Bot-driven automation MUST preserve full bidirectional communication threads as proof."*

Every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded end-to-end communication transcript plus any attached materials (screenshots, request/response payloads, audio, file uploads) committed under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` — one directory per feature run. Operative rule: (1) every consuming project MUST maintain a `docs/qa/` tree, each new feature under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` where `<run-id>` is monotonic + greppable (timestamp / ATM-NNN / other workable-item ID per §11.4.54); (2) transcripts MUST be full bidirectional — every prompt/command sent + every response received (one-sided is not a transcript); (3) attached materials MUST be committed in-repo (no external-only links — that is a §11.4.13 sink-side violation); (4) bot-driven / agent-driven QA automation MUST preserve the full conversation thread as the proof artefact; (5) release gates MUST refuse to tag a version that has any feature-shipping commit without its matching `docs/qa/<run-id>/` directory. A feature with no QA transcript is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff. Composes with §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.13 / §11.4.65 / §11.4.69 / §1.1.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.83` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-83-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no `--qa-evidence-optional` escape hatch.

## §11.4.84 — Working-Tree Quiescence Rule for Subagent Commits (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.84)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"no subagent commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate is in flight in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST `grep` its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, etc.). Any unexplained file in the staging area triggers ABORT."*

No subagent (or main-thread) commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate, paired-mutation experiment, or other in-flight mutation is live in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST grep its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, `// MUTATION` / `# MUTATION` annotations, `_mutated_*` filename suffixes, etc.) and explicitly account for every modified file in the staging area; any unexplained file → ABORT. (Forensic case: a logo-fix subagent's `git add` swept an `// always pass` JWT-verify mutation residue into an unrelated commit pushed to all four mirrors — a real security-defect window.) Operative rule: (1) pre-`git add` greps for mutation markers + cross-checks `git status --porcelain` against the subagent's declared scope; unaccounted entries → ABORT; (2) any active mutation gate MUST be serialised (mutate → assert FAIL → restore → assert PASS) and the working tree verifiably clean before any unrelated commit; (3) concurrent subagents in the SAME checkout MUST coordinate through a lockfile (`.git/MUTATION_IN_PROGRESS`) — cleaner solution is `git worktree add` per subagent (composes with §11.4.20/§11.4.70); (4) post-commit `mutation-residue-scanner` MUST run before push — any commit containing a mutation marker → push BLOCKED.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.84` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-84-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. A mutation marker that lands in a tagged commit is a critical defect regardless of how briefly it persisted.

## §11.4.85 — Stress + Chaos Test Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.85)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-24): *"Every fix or improvement you do MUST BE covered with full automation stress and chaos tests so we are sure nothing can break the functionality and all edge cases are monitored and polished and additionally fixed if that is needed! Everything must produce rock solid proofs and follow fully no-bluff policy!"*

Every fix or improvement landed MUST ship with full-automation **stress** AND **chaos** test suites exercising edge cases, sustained load, concurrent contention, and failure-injection. Happy-path coverage alone is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff at the resilience layer. **Stress** (closed-set): sustained load (N ≥ 100 iterations OR ≥ 30 s wall-clock, p50/p95/p99 latency recorded) + concurrent contention (N ≥ 10 parallel invocations, no deadlock/leak) + boundary conditions (empty/max/off-by-one, each categorised). **Chaos** (closed-set, per fix-class appropriateness): process-death injection + network-fault injection (drop/delay/reorder) + input-corruption injection + resource-exhaustion injection (disk full, OOM, FD exhaustion — refuse cleanly OR degrade, NEVER crash) + state-corruption injection (mid-flight lock loss, partial-write). Every stress + chaos PASS MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path per §11.4.5 + §11.4.69. Helper library `stress_chaos.sh` provides `ab_stress_run`, `ab_stress_concurrent`, `ab_chaos_kill_pid_during`, `ab_chaos_drop_network_during`, `ab_chaos_corrupt_file_during`, `ab_chaos_oom_pressure_during`, `ab_chaos_disk_full_during`, each composing with `ab_pass_with_evidence` / `ab_skip_with_reason`. Cleanup non-negotiable in `trap '...' EXIT` (cleanup failure = §11.4.14 violation). Four-layer coverage per §11.4.4(b) + paired §1.1 mutation (strip chaos-injection or evidence-capture → gate FAILs). No escape hatch — no `--skip-stress`, `--no-chaos`, `--happy-path-suffices`, `--stress-test-later` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.85` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-85-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.86 — Roster/Corpus-Backed Status-Doc Auto-Sync Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.86)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-25): *"Make sure that assets and players Status docs are ALWAYS regularly updated and in sync like all others Status docs — any time we add or modify the assets content(s) or we change or add new / remove existing pre-installed video and audio player apps! This MUST WORK OUT OF THE BOX!"*

Some Status docs (§11.4.45) are backed by a tracked roster (installed apps/components) or a tracked asset corpus (test/media asset directory) rather than narrative alone. Their freshness MUST NOT depend on operator vigilance — the moment a roster/corpus member changes (app added/removed/renamed; asset added/modified/removed) the Status doc + Status_Summary + HTML + PDF MUST resync out of the box, mechanically. Mechanism (all must hold): (1) drift-proof fingerprint — sha256 of the sorted member list (NOT mtime), persisted in a sidecar beside the Status doc; (2) a sync helper that regenerates the fingerprint + re-exports HTML+PDF via the §11.4.65 exporter, wired so sync is automatic; (3) a pre-build gate that FAILs when the live fingerprint differs from the persisted one (mirrors §11.4.12 `CM-ISSUES-SUMMARY-SYNC` + §11.4.45 `sync_integration_status`); (4) a paired §1.1 mutation corrupting the fingerprint and asserting the gate FAILs. Classification: universal — the consuming project supplies the specific docs, roster/corpus sources, helper, and gate name per §11.4.35.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.86` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-86-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no `--skip-roster-sync`, `--allow-status-drift`, `--roster-sync-not-applicable` flag.

## §11.4.87 — Endless-Loop Autonomous Work + Zero-Idle Agent Dispatch + Anti-Bluff Testing Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.87)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-26): *"continue in endless loop fully autonomously"* (and any semantically-equivalent phrasing).

When the operator instructs an AI agent to continue in an endless autonomous loop, the agent MUST treat it as a HARD-CONTRACT covenant: (A) continue working until `docs/Issues.md` Status-column has zero non-terminal entries AND `docs/CONTINUATION.md` §3 Active work is empty AND no background subagent is mid-execution AND no external dependency is in-flight; (B) dispatch background subagents for parallelisable work — main + every subagent operate concurrently, "waiting for results" is the ONLY acceptable idle reason; (C) every closure lands four-layer test coverage per §11.4.4(b) with captured-evidence (audio/video/network/UI/sysfs physical proofs); (D) the §11.4 anti-bluff covenant family (§11.4.1 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.68 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83) is the operative truth-discipline — tests AND HelixQA Challenges bound equally; (E) the loop terminates ONLY on all-conditions-met, explicit operator STOP, host-session-safety demand, or scheduled wake on a known-future-actionable signal. No escape hatch — no `--idle-OK`, `--skip-endless-loop`, `--bluff-permitted-for-this-task`, `--metadata-only-test-suffices`, `--no-physical-proof-required` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.87` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-87-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.88 — Background-Push Mandate: Commit-Lock Release Immediately After Commit, Push Runs Detached (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.88)

Forensic anchor (2026-05-26): a single `commit_all.sh` held its flock ~5 hours because `do_push` ran synchronously after the commit landed — every subsequent commit blocked on a slow mirror push irrelevant to the local commit's durability. Implementation seam for §11.4.87(B) zero-idle. The mandate: (A) `.git/.commit_all.lock` MUST be released IMMEDIATELY after `git commit` returns 0 — the commit is durable on local disk regardless of remote push outcome; (B) push runs detached via `nohup ./push_all.sh ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` — the orchestrator's exit code reports COMMIT success, NOT push success; (C) `push_all.sh` acquires per-remote flock `.git/.push.<remote>.lock` so concurrent invocations targeting the same remote serialize but different-remote invocations run in parallel; (D) backgrounded push failures land in `qa-results/push_failures/<ts>_<remote>.log` — the next autonomous-loop tick checks per §11.4.87(A) "no external dependency in-flight" gate; (E) synchronous-push escape: explicit `--sync-push` CLI flag preserves legacy behaviour for §11.4.41 force-push merge-first audit paths. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-PUSH-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations. Synchronous push (without `--sync-push`) = §11.4 PASS-bluff at the execution layer.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.88` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond `--sync-push` for force-push events.

## §11.4.89 — Background Test Execution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.89)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Any tests we are executing, especially long test cycles, MUST BE performed in background in parallel with main work stream! This MUST NOT block our capabilities to work on queued workable items. Main work stream can be blocked or sit iddle only if absolutely needed and if it depends hard on results of some background execution."*

Symmetric anchor to §11.4.88 (background push) at the test-execution layer. Mandate: (A) long-running tests (>30 s expected: `pre_build`, `meta_test`, `test_all_fixes`, `recent_work_validate`, HelixQA banks, 4-phase cycles, full-suite retests, audio supervisors, dual-display recorders) MUST run via `nohup ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` with the log under a known dir (`qa-results/<test_id>_<ts>.log`); (B) the main stream proceeds to the §11.4.42 priority queue immediately; (C) hard-dependency gating — poll an exit-status file or `pgrep -af <test>` before steps that need the exit code, surfacing as §11.4.66 interactive options if the test is still running; (D) failures land in `<log>` files, the next loop tick checks; (E) foreground execution permitted ONLY for <30 s tests OR explicit operator authorisation; (F) per-script flock serialises same-script invocations, different-script invocations parallel. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-TEST-EXECUTION-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.89` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.

## §11.4.90 — Obsolete Status + Per-Item Obsolescence Audit (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.90)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Bug No 6 ... seems obsolete after latest request for new behavior ... mark obsolete tickets with some light gray background ... text - the description to be strikethrough styled ... review all existing open or resolved workable items if they are obsolete - not valid any more ... There MUST NOT be any mistake! No bluff is allowed of any kind!"*

The §11.4.15 Status closed-set is extended with a terminal `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)` value (orthogonal to Type per §11.4.16). Obsolescence reasons (closed vocabulary): `superseded-by-design-change | superseded-by-later-mandate | feature-removed | duplicate-of | unsupported-topology`. Every Obsolete heading MUST carry an `**Obsolete-Details:**` line (Since + Reason + Superseding-item + Triple-check evidence) within 8 non-blank lines. The §11.4.23 colorizer adds a `cell-status-obsolete` class — light-gray `#E0E0E0` background + strikethrough description. Audit cadence: every release-gate sweep per §11.4.40 + §11.4.42; triple-check is non-negotiable per the operator mandate. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.21 / §11.4.23 / §11.4.33 / §11.4.34 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.71.

For each workable item we MUST HAVE clearly understandable meaning ... every team member can clearly understand what that particular workable item is exactly about! There cannot be misunderstanding or unclearity of any kind and no bluff allowed!"*

Every summary entry (Issues_Summary, Fixed_Summary, README doc-link, Status_Summary pages 1+2, all one-liners) MUST contain a self-contained meaningful description ≥ 6 words OR ≥ 40 chars naming SUBJECT + PROBLEM/GOAL. Forbidden one-liner anti-patterns: section labels (`Composes with`, `Closure criteria`, `Fix direction`, etc.); bare metadata fragments (`Critical`, `Bug`, `In progress`, etc.); section-marker echoes; a §-letter alone. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh` / `generate_fixed_summary.sh` / `update_readme_doc_links.sh` / `generate_status_summary.sh`) MUST extract from the H1/H2 heading line per the §11.4.54 ATM-NNN convention, NEVER from arbitrary downstream text, and MUST refuse anti-pattern rows — emitting a `(MISSING DESCRIPTION — fix source heading)` placeholder with visual highlight.

## §11.4.93 — SQLite-Backed Single-Source-of-Truth for Workable Items (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.93)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"There MUST be single source of truth for all of our workable items - SQlite database ... proper scripts (we recommend Go programs) ... reduce a chance for sync to be broken ... generate always all docs from DB or to re-generate Db from all docs we have in opposite direction"*

The text-based Issues/Fixed/Summary/CONTINUATION constellation is converted to a SQLite-DB-backed single source of truth. Schema mandatory tables: `items` (atm_id PK + Type + Status incl. Obsolete + Severity + title + description ≥40 chars + created/modified + composes_with JSON + current_location); `item_history` (append-only audit per §11.4.34 By/Reason/Evidence); `obsolete_details` (§11.4.90); `operator_block_details` (§11.4.21); `firebase_metadata` (§11.4.47); `meta` (schema version + last sync + integrity hash). A Go binary at `cmd/workable-items/` provides `sync md-to-db` / `db-to-md` / `diff` / `validate` / `add` / `close`; bidirectional regen is byte-identical round-trip (closed-set whitespace/section-order tolerance). `commit_all.sh` refuses on non-empty diff; `sync_issues_docs.sh` invokes the Go binary; pre-build runs `workable-items validate`. Anti-bluff: unit + integration + stress (1000-row insert + 10 concurrent writers) + chaos (mid-write SIGKILL + corrupt-DB recovery + disk-full) + paired §1.1 mutation + HelixQA Challenge `CME-WORKABLE-ITEMS-001`. The Go binary lives in the constitution submodule (`constitution/scripts/workable-items/`) per §11.4.74. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-93-PROPAGATION` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-DB-PRESENT` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-MD-DB-IN-SYNC` + paired §1.1 mutations.

Can we work on something in parallel while build is in progress so we slowly cleanup our slate? ... do as much as possible work in background in parallel with main work stream and oreferrably using subagents-driven approach!"*

An operational catalogue for the canonical long-running workload (multi-hour containerised build per §12.9). **SAFE during build:** (A) MD/docs work; (B) generator/helper script work under `scripts/`; (C) pre-build + meta-test gate authoring + paired §1.1 mutations; (D) on-device test scripts; (E) constitution submodule edits + push; (F) any submodule commit + push per §11.4.88; (G) read-only live-ADB probes (`dumpsys`/`getprop`/`cat /proc/...`/`screencap`/`logcat`); (H) subagent dispatch per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 + §11.4.84 quiescence; (I) web research + external API queries with §11.4.10 credentials; (J) workable-items DB ops per §11.4.93+§11.4.95; (K) backgrounded pre-build + meta-test execution per §11.4.89. **UNSAFE during build:** (α) `git checkout`/`reset --hard`/`clean -df` on the source tree (use `git worktree`); (β) mass file deletes/renames under built source trees; (γ) submodule pointer updates affecting built artefacts; (δ) `out/` mutations; (ε) `make clean`/`m clobber`/`rm -rf out/`; (ζ) container destruction; (η) disk-filling breaching §12.9 free-space minimum; (θ) §12 host-session-safety breaches.

Operating-mode capstone strengthening §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 + §11.4.96: (A) every minute of conductor idle time during which work could autonomously progress AND is not genuinely blocked = a §11.4.97 violation; "as much as possible, if not it all but as much as we can" is operative — dispatch CONTINUOUSLY through the entire idle window, not just at scheduled wakes; (B) progress-update cadence — emit an operator-facing 1-line update at every commit landed / subagent return / constitutional anchor / captured evidence / milestone closure, no operator prompt required; (C) continuous physical-proof gathering per §11.4.5 + §11.4.6 + §11.4.69 — every autonomous closure cites captured-evidence (evidence path goes into the §11.4.93 `item_history.evidence_path` when the DB lands); (D) composes with §11.4.5/6/13/20/27/42/50/52/69/70/72/83/85/87/88/89/94/96; (E) the idle-only-when-blocked closed-set is unchanged from §11.4.94(A).

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"We shall not Git ignore our workable items SQlite DB since it is our single source of truth ... workable items SQlite DB regularly commited and pushed to all upstreams!"*

§11.4.93's earlier "gitignored per §11.4.30" clause is AMENDED — the DB at `docs/workable_items.db` is TRACKED in git, NEVER gitignored. It IS authoritative source data, NOT a build artefact. Every `workable-items sync md-to-db` that mutates state MUST stage + commit + push the DB alongside the MD regen per §11.4.19 atomic-move + §2.1 multi-upstream push. A WAL-checkpoint (`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) is required before commit-stage so the transient `.db-wal` + `.db-shm` sidecars (gitignored per §11.4.30) are safely discardable. The §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism does NOT apply — the DB IS the source. Destructive DB ops require §9.2 hardlinked-backup + operator authorization; §11.4.41 force-push merge-first applies if DB history ever needs rewrite.

## §11.4.98 — Full-Automation Anti-Bluff Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.98)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28): *"Make sure we have full automation testing of all scenarios with real bot, main group and users without any manual intervention or contribution of real user! Everything MUST BE fully automatic and autonomous! These tests MUST BE able to rerun endless times when needed! ... Make sure there is no false positives in testing! Every test and its results MUST obtain real proofs of everything working! No bluff is allowed!"*

Closes the manual-intervention gap (§11.4 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.85 / §11.4.87 / §11.4.89 / §11.4.94 did not explicitly forbid it). A live/integration/e2e/Challenge test that requires a human action during execution (typing a message, clicking UI, hand-triggering a webhook, attaching a file — anything beyond startup) is by definition a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the automation layer. (A) Every governed test — unit/integration/e2e/Challenge/stress/chaos/live — MUST be fully self-driving end-to-end, reporting PASS/FAIL/SKIP-with-reason without any further human action after startup. (B) Single permissible exception: one-time credential bootstrap performed OUTSIDE test execution (`.env` from vault, shell exports, OAuth at first install, MTProto session activation) — configuration, not test driving. (C) Live messenger/channel/agent tests: no "operator must type" prompts (drive programmatically via second account / webhook fixture / loopback); no hard-coded session UUIDs that collide with the active dev session (Herald 2026-05-28 `claude --resume` silent exit -1 lesson); no 60 s human-response windows (§11.4.50 determinism violation); re-runnability proof — PASS at `-count=3` consecutive automated invocations with self-cleaning state; §11.4.98 obsolescence audit classifies every existing test COMPLIANT vs NON-COMPLIANT; no silent-skip-reported-as-PASS or stale-evidence-as-fresh. (D) With §11.4.85 + §11.4.89 + §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 forms a continuously-validated, non-flake, anti-bluff regime.

## §11.4.99 — Latest-Source Documentation Cross-Reference Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.99)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28): *"Make sure we ALWAYS check against latest versions of services we use web / online docs before creating instructions! This situation is illustration of how we can misguide ourselves or get banned! ... These are mandatory rules / constraints and the result is consistency and safety of created instructions, guides and manuals!"*

Misguidance-by-stale-docs is the same severity class as a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the documentation layer (Herald 2026-05-28 case: a first-draft MTProto guide recommended VoIP fallback numbers and omitted the `recover@telegram.org` pre-login email — both contradicted Telegram's official docs + the gotd/td maintainer guide and could have caused a permanent account ban). Closes the gap §11.4.92 Pass 4 alludes to but does not mandate. (A) Before committing any operator-facing instruction/guide/manual/troubleshooting/setup doc, the author MUST: (1) fetch the LATEST official online documentation of the documented service/library via WebFetch / MCP / direct browsing — NEVER training data, memory, or prior committed docs; (2) cross-reference every instruction step against that source; (3) seek secondary authoritative sources (maintainer SUPPORT.md, official changelogs, vetted community FAQs) when the official source is sparse/silent; (4) cite source URLs + date in a `## Sources verified` footer in the doc; (5) cite a `Sources verified <date>: <urls>` footer in the commit message. (B) Negative findings (gaps/silences/contradictions) MUST be documented explicitly. (C) Docs older than 6 months are STALE — re-verify before citing as operator authority, at every vN.0.0 release boundary, on service breaking-change announcements, or on operator error reports. (D) Risk-classified services (messengers, cloud APIs, payment systems, AI/LLM providers, code-hosting, package managers) carry a 90-day max staleness + explicit safety warnings. (E) Composes with but is INDEPENDENT of §11.4.92 Pass 4. (G) Commit missing either footer is BLOCKED at release-gate; stale-beyond-grace docs graduate to §11.4.90 Obsolete (`Reason=stale-documentation`).

## §11.4.101 — Autonomous-Decision-Over-Blocking Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.101)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28): *"when working in endless working loop fully autonomously try to decide most properly about points which would block execution and wait for us. If we haven't answered now work would be blocked whole night! If possible and if that will not cause any issues make proper and most reliable and safe decision so we achieve maximal efficiency and work gets fully done!"*

In autonomous / endless-loop mode (per §11.4.87), the agent MUST minimize operator-blocking and make the safe, reliable, reversible decision itself so work is not stalled (e.g. overnight) waiting for input — §11.4.87 says keep working, §11.4.101 says HOW to clear the decision points. **Proceed-autonomously (closed-set, ALL must hold):** (a) the action is reversible OR has a captured pre-op backup per §9.2; (b) the safe choice is determinable from captured evidence per §11.4.6 (no guessing — `LIKELY`/`probably`/`seems` is NOT a determination); (c) a wrong choice's blast radius is bounded AND recoverable; (d) it composes with anti-bluff §11.4, host-safety §12, data-safety §9. **Block-only-when (BLOCK via the §11.4.66 interactive mechanism ONLY when ALL hold):** the action is irreversible AND high-blast-radius AND the safe choice cannot be determined from evidence — e.g. external-account state the agent cannot inspect, hardware it cannot access, destructive ops without backup, force-push (also §9.2 + §11.4.41), spending money or sending data to third parties. `Operator-blocked` per §11.4.21 is reached only after this rule fires AND the self-resolution-exhaustion audit completes. An unavoidable block parks one work unit — it does NOT pause the loop; the agent keeps progressing every non-blocked item in parallel per §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 (posing the question then going idle is a §11.4.94 + §11.4.97 violation).

## §11.4.102 — Mandatory systematic-debugging activation + always-loaded skill-discovery + plugin-dependency availability (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.102)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-29): *"Make sure that we ALWAYS trigger / start the "/superpowers:systematic-debugging" skills when any issues happen! If this is possible to activate and use in this situations out of the box when we spot problems / issues / bugs / misalignments / unconsistencies we MUST activate the skill(s) and make strongest efforts in full in depth analisys / debugging and determine root causes of all problem or obtain relevant data and information we need! ... we MUST make sure that "/using-superpowers" skill is ALWAYS loaded, applied and used! All dependencies (plugins) that Claude Code or other market places are offering MUST BE installed if these are not already available for loading and use!"

Three cooperating invariants — the difference between guess-and-retry and investigate-to-root-cause-first. **(A) Mandatory systematic-debugging activation.** On ANY spotted issue / bug / test failure / gate failure / regression / misalignment / inconsistency / unexpected behaviour, the agent MUST activate `superpowers:systematic-debugging` (or the platform-equivalent structured-debugging discipline) **BEFORE proposing, writing, or applying any fix** — the **Iron Law: NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.** Full four-phase arc: root-cause → pattern → hypothesis → implementation. Guess-and-retry, symptom-patching, and re-running a failed test hoping it passes ("probably transient / flaky") WITHOUT a completed investigation are §11.4.102 violations; calling a failure `transient`/`flaky`/`intermittent`/`probably-timing` without captured forensic evidence is simultaneously a §11.4.6 and §11.4.7 violation. **(B) Mandatory always-loaded `using-superpowers`.** `superpowers:using-superpowers` (or platform-equivalent skill-discovery discipline) MUST be loaded and applied at session start and consulted before any task; if ANY skill could apply — even at 1% relevance — it MUST be invoked rather than improvised from memory. **(C) Mandatory plugin / dependency availability.** Every skill plugin / marketplace package / capability dependency the project relies on MUST be installed + loadable BEFORE the dependent work proceeds; a missing plugin that blocks a mandated skill is a release-blocker until installed + confirmed loadable (install exit 0 ≠ skill loadable — confirm by observing the skill in the live capability list). Composes with §11.4.4 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.8 / §11.4.43 / §11.4.70 / §11.4.82(A) / §11.4.92. Classification: universal (§11.4.17).

### §11.4.122 — No-silent-removal-of-existing-components-without-operator-confirmation mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-03)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-03):**

> "Never ever remove any application, system component or service from already existing codebase / System without interactively asked question to us! THIS IS MANDATORY RULE / CONSTRAINT!"

**Forensic case study (FACT).** During the 1.1.8-dev burn-down, two shipped capabilities — F2 (an Apple-TV-class application) and F4 (a Huawei HMS / Mobile-Services component) — were removed from the existing System WITHOUT first asking the operator; the operator reversed both. A removal the operator has to discover and reverse after the fact is a defect of the same severity class as a §11.4 PASS-bluff: the System silently lost a user-facing capability the operator never agreed to drop.

No application, system component, service, package, feature, driver, module, library, prebuilt asset — any already-existing end-user capability of the existing codebase / shipped System — may be removed (deleted, dropped from the package set, disabled-into-non-shipping, un-bundled, de-listed, or otherwise made unavailable to the end user) WITHOUT FIRST interactively asking the operator and receiving an EXPLICIT keep-or-remove decision. The question MUST be posed through the platform's interactive clarification mechanism per §11.4.66 (`AskUserQuestion` on Claude Code) — NEVER a free-text "should I remove X?" buried in narrative, NEVER a silent removal justified post-hoc, NEVER an autonomous removal decision. A silent removal is a **release blocker** regardless of how well-intentioned the rationale (deduplication, "it was broken anyway", geo-restricted, incompatible, superseded) — the operator decides, the agent asks.

What counts as a removal (non-exhaustive): deleting an app/APK/binary from the build's package set (`PRODUCT_PACKAGES` / `device.mk` / equivalent), removing a service from the init/boot/service-registry set, dropping a kernel module / driver / config from the shipping configuration, un-bundling a prebuilt asset, deleting a submodule or its shipped output, removing a feature flag that gated a live capability, or any edit whose NET EFFECT is "an end-user capability that shipped before no longer ships." Adding, replacing-with-operator-approved-equivalent, or fixing a capability is NOT a removal. When uncertain whether an edit constitutes a removal, treat it AS a removal and ask (per §11.4.6 no-guessing + §11.4.101 — removal of an existing user-facing capability is high-blast-radius and MUST be operator-confirmed, never autonomously decided). The tracked DROP path: ask → operator approves → mark the item `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)` with `Obsolete-Details` reason `feature-removed` + an operator-approval citation (§11.4.90) → then remove; the removal never precedes the operator's yes.

Classification: universal (§11.4.17) — a platform-neutral discipline reusable by ANY project that ships a set of user-facing capabilities; the consuming project supplies its concrete capability-manifest paths per §11.4.35. Composes §11.4.66 / §11.4.101 / §11.4.90 / §11.4.112 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42.

### §11.4.123 — Rock-solid-proof-or-deep-research mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-03)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-03):**

> "Every single reported issue MUST BE fully and 100% validated with rock solid proofs! Nothing can be considered fixed or completed without hard evidence! No false results or bluff(s) of any kind is allowed! If we are not sure on how to achieve full testing, validation and verification of something we MUST ALWAYS perform deep web research for all possible data (articles, documentation, guides, and other resources) and opensourced codebases which we can use to solve our problems and perform testing with validation and verification which produces rock-solid evidence(s) and leaves no space for false results or any kind of bluff!"

**Forensic case study (FACT).** In the 1.1.8-dev remediation the validation method for two feature classes was, at first, genuinely unclear: relocating a `FLAG_SECURE` secure surface to a secondary display (pixel capture returns black) and asserting on-screen content in non-introspectable streaming-app UIs (blank accessibility hierarchy). Rather than declaring them "untestable" or accepting a metadata-only PASS, the cycle performed deep web research (`docs/research/testing_frameworks_20260603/`) that yielded the CV/OCR/liveness/sink-probe oracle stack (now §11.4.107 + §11.4.112 + §11.4.117) — making rock-solid evidence possible where it had appeared impossible. "Unclear how to validate" is a research trigger, NEVER a bluff licence.

Every single reported issue, every fix, and every claimed completion MUST be fully and 100% validated with rock-solid CAPTURED proof per §11.4.5 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107 before it may be marked fixed / implemented / completed (§11.4.33 closure vocabulary). Nothing may be considered fixed or complete without hard captured evidence — metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime PASS are all forbidden (§11.4 / §11.4.1); no false results, no bluff of any kind, at any layer.

The research-or-don't-bluff rule (the operative addition): when the agent is UNSURE how to fully test / validate / verify something — when no obvious evidence-producing method exists OR the candidate method would yield only metadata/config/absence-of-error evidence — it MUST ALWAYS first perform deep web research per §11.4.8 + §11.4.99 (official docs, articles, guides, vendor references, standards, issue trackers, reusable open-source codebases) to DISCOVER or BUILD a validation method that produces rock-solid evidence and leaves no space for a false result. Declaring something "untestable" / "not automatable" / accepting a metadata-only PASS WITHOUT first exhausting this deep-research path is itself a §11.4.123 violation — same severity class as a PASS-bluff.

### §11.4.124 — Dead/unwired-code investigate-before-remove mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-04)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-04):**

> "Before removing any seemingly-dead (zero-importer / unwired) codebase, we MUST investigate via git history where/how it was originally used and how it became dead. Removal is permitted ONLY when we have captured PROOF it is genuinely no longer needed — and that removal MUST be its own separate commit with a proper descriptive message. If there is no such proof, the code MUST be investigated for where/how it should be wired in properly, and any missing or unwired tests MUST be added. We MUST ALWAYS be extra careful with any codebase removal."

"Zero importers / never called / unwired ⇒ dead ⇒ delete" is a GUESS (§11.4.6), never a finding — a "no references" result proves only *current* non-reference, not genuinely-unneeded. Before removing ANY seemingly-dead element (zero-importer / never-called / unwired function / method / type / file / module / package / asset / config / build target) the agent MUST FIRST investigate via git history (`git log --follow`, `git log -S`/`-G` pickaxe across all history, blame on the deleted call-site) and capture as FACT: (1) WHERE/HOW it was originally wired in, (2) WHEN/HOW it became dead — call-site deleted deliberately / by mistake (regression) / never-completed / refactored-unreachable, (3) whether "no references" is real OR a hidden reference the static tool cannot see (reflection / dynamic dispatch / build-tags / codegen / DI / plugin registry / FFI / config-driven wiring). The investigation output (cited commits + determination) is the captured evidence. **Removal is conditional:** permitted ONLY with captured PROOF the element is genuinely no longer needed; that removal MUST be its OWN SEPARATE COMMIT (independently reviewable + revertible, composes §11.4.84 quiescence + §11.4.92 multi-pass) with a descriptive message citing the git-history evidence — plus §11.4.122 operator-confirmation when the element is an end-user capability; the §11.4.90 tracked path marks it `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)`. **No proof ⇒ do NOT delete:** investigate WHERE/HOW to wire it in properly (restore a mistakenly-deleted call-site per §11.4.114; finish never-completed wiring) AND add any missing / unwired tests (§11.4.27 / §11.4.43 / §11.4.115 — the missing test is part of why it drifted into apparent-deadness). **Extra-caution default:** when uncertain whether removal-proof is sufficient, default to NOT removing (investigate + wire + test) per §11.4.6 + §11.4.101 + §11.4.122; "probably dead" is never sufficient — the bar is captured proof.

### §11.4.125 — Code-review-agent gate before pre-build + main build (mandatory multi-layer review) (User mandate, 2026-06-04)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-04):**

> "After all fixes/changes/implementations are done, BEFORE running pre-build tests and the main build, dispatch code-review agent(s) that analyze all work done + all existing data/facts + the existing codebase + current git history to determine quality, safety, and whether the fixes/changes will REALLY work; they MUST validate and verify that every test covering the fixes/changes genuinely validates the work with NO chance of false results or bluff of any kind. Any finding MUST be fixed, polished, improved, and covered with additional tests before the build proceeds. Multiple strong layers of checks."

After all fixes / changes / implementations in a batch are done, and BEFORE running the pre-build test sweep AND the main (artifact) build (for ANY project), the agent MUST dispatch one or more dedicated code-review agent(s) (subagent-driven by default per §11.4.70/§11.4.20) performing a multi-layer review that: (1) analyzes ALL work done in the batch (every fix/change + its source diff + stated intent); (2) analyzes ALL existing data + facts (captured evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69/§11.4.107, tracker entries, prior findings, the §11.4.108 runtime-signature registry); (3) analyzes the existing codebase (blast radius per §11.4.92, cross-feature interaction, contract integrity of every dependency); (4) analyzes current git history (what each change touched, how it composes with concurrent/recent work, whether it reproduces a known-broken pattern per §11.4.114/§11.4.124); (5) determines quality + safety + will-it-REALLY-work (robust + not error-prone — no solve-A-create-B; no host/data/security regression; genuinely delivers the end-user-visible behaviour per §11.4/§107); (6) validates + verifies the tests covering the work — every covering test genuinely exercises the work-under-test and catches its negation, with ZERO chance of a false result or bluff (a test that PASSes on broken-for-the-user work, a metadata-only/config-only/absence-of-error/grep-without-runtime assertion, or a gate whose paired §1.1 mutation does not make it FAIL is a finding). Any finding (defect / error-prone change / safety risk / will-not-really-work / bluff-or-false-result-capable test / missing-coverage gap) MUST be fixed, polished, improved, and covered with additional tests (four-layer per §11.4.4(b), TDD-RED-first per §11.4.43/§11.4.115) BEFORE the pre-build sweep + main build proceed; the review iterates (re-review after each remediation) until no blocking findings remain. The review is itself anti-bluff (its conclusions are captured evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69; a rubber-stamp review of a defective batch = PASS-bluff). It is one of MULTIPLE STRONG LAYERS — complementing, never replacing, the §1 pre-build sweep, §11.4.92 multi-pass (author-side self-review; §11.4.125 adds the structurally-separated reviewer seam per §11.4.70), §11.4.108 four-layer fix-verification, §11.4.110 build-readiness verdict, and the post-build / runtime-on-clean-target / user-visible layers.

### §11.4.126 — Default autonomous-loop working mode from first prompt (User mandate, 2026-06-04)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-04):**

> "Make sure that you continue work in endless fully autonomous loop, do not stop until new fully validated and verified version (tag) is created and published (all submodules and main repo) or IN A CASE OF some other main stream work until it is fully completed with all side work streams and nothing else is left in our working queue! THIS MUST BE ALWAYS the default working mode without us asking you! We tend to achieve ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY, with this and all other projects which will incorporate this MANDATORY RULE / CONSTRAINT!!! This way of (your) working will be ALWAYS applied / followed / executed / fully respected, as soon as we assign / send first request (prompt) in the session! This stops only if we explicitly say so or nothing is left to be done in current working scope (release that will come / upcoming version)!!! Any mimicking (imitation) of this behavior / rules / mandatory constraints, false results or any kind of bluff(s) is ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN!!!"

The endless fully-autonomous loop is the **DEFAULT working mode**, engaged automatically the moment the operator sends the FIRST request / prompt of a session — the operator MUST NOT have to ask for it, request it, restate it, or re-enable it per session. §11.4.87 framed the endless-loop covenant as an explicit-instruction opt-in ("continue in endless loop fully autonomously" or a semantically-equivalent phrasing); §11.4.126 is the **capstone** that promotes the same covenant to always-on: from the first prompt onward, every agent operates in the §11.4.87 loop discipline as the standing default, with §11.4.94 zero-idle, §11.4.97 maximum-idle-use, §11.4.101 autonomous-decision-over-blocking, and §11.4.103 continuous-parallel-stream all engaged by default — no per-session activation handshake. The continuation contract: the loop continues until ONE of two terminal conditions holds — (A) **Release scope** — a new, fully-validated-and-verified version (tag) is created AND published across all owned submodules AND the main repo to all configured remotes (per §2.1 multi-upstream push + §11.4.40 full-suite-retest-before-tag + §11.4.113 absolute-no-force-push merge-onto-latest-main); OR (B) **Non-release main-stream scope** — the main-stream goal is fully completed AND every side work stream is done AND the working queue holds nothing left for the current scope. Until (A) or (B) holds, the agent MUST keep working (claim the next priority item, dispatch the next parallel stream, progress every non-blocked item per §11.4.42 / §11.4.72 / §11.4.94 / §11.4.103). The loop STOPS ONLY on: (1) the operator explicitly saying so (STOP / pause / end); (2) nothing left to do in the current working scope — the upcoming release / current main-stream goal — with the queue genuinely empty per the (A)/(B) terminal conditions; (3) a §12 host-session-safety demand (the loop yields to host safety unconditionally). Idle-while-blocked parks one work unit, it does not stop the loop — the agent keeps progressing every non-blocked item in parallel per §11.4.101 + §11.4.94 + §11.4.97. Goal — ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY (no operator-side restart overhead, no idle gaps, no stop-and-wait round-trips); applies to this project AND every project that incorporates this Constitution. Anti-bluff: mimicking / imitating this loop behaviour, narrating continuation without performing it, fabricating progress, or emitting false / bluff results of ANY kind is ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN — this composes the entire §11.4 anti-bluff covenant family (§11.4 / §11.4.1 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107); the agent MUST genuinely perform the continuous work and capture positive evidence for every closure, and a report claiming the loop ran while no real work / no captured evidence was produced is a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the operating-mode layer. Classification: universal (§11.4.17). Composes with §11.4.87 (the endless-loop covenant — §11.4.126 promotes it from opt-in to always-on default) / §11.4.94 / §11.4.97 / §11.4.101 / §11.4.103 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.72 / §11.4.113 / §2.1 / §12. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-126-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.126` across the consumer fleet) + paired §1.1 meta-test mutation (strip the literal → propagation gate FAILs; gate-code = separate work item).

### §11.4.127 — Session-handoff resumption-prompt mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-06)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-06):** "make sure that in situations like this now when new session is needed you ALWAYS prepera such sentence - which will be valid for particular moment and the phase of the project and enough for work to continue."

When the agent determines a fresh session is needed (context-window limits, performance degradation) OR the operator asks whether a new session is needed / requests a handoff, the agent MUST ALWAYS prepare + proactively provide a ready-to-paste **resumption prompt valid for that EXACT moment and project phase** — self-contained enough that pasting it into a fresh session resumes work with ZERO loss. Two variants on demand: a SHORT first-sentence ("Read `<handoff docs>`, then continue `<terminal goal>` …") AND a FULL detailed block. The prompt MUST: (1) point to the live handoff doc(s) — `.remember/remember.md` if present + `docs/CONTINUATION.md` per §12.10 — read FIRST + `git fetch --all`; (2) state current PHASE + immediate NEXT action + terminal goal; (3) embed exact live-state anchors (build IDs / artifact MD5, device/target serials, commit HEAD, in-flight PIDs + log paths, captured-evidence paths); (4) restate binding constraints (anti-bluff §11.4, no-force-push §11.4.113, exact version/naming, hardware/target gotchas); (5) be MOMENT-VALID, NEVER a generic template. Handoff doc(s) MUST be current BEFORE the prompt is given (§12.10). A missing / stale / generic prompt is a §11.4.127 violation. Composes §12.10 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.87 / §11.4.103 / §11.4.126. Classification: universal (§11.4.17).

### §11.4.128 — Always-on device-recording mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-06)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (2026-06-06):** we MUST ALWAYS live-record all available data from all devices we use for testing (or known to be under manual testing), EXTRA carefully so it never harms the device / its performance / causes side effects; raw recordings are NOT processed without need (token-conscious) and are ALWAYS git-ignored + code-intelligence-excluded; only curated evidence is committed, and only at release prep.

For EVERY test/debug device the project uses + every device under known manual testing, across EVERY reachable transport (USB / wireless ADB / SSH / serial / network introspection API), the project MUST ALWAYS live-record all analysable data: activities, all logs, performance metrics (CPU/memory/I/O/thermal/load), every sink-side report per §11.4.13, and any other live-changeable parameter. (1) **Extra-careful, side-effect-free** — non-invasive read-only probes only, bounded sampling, bounded write-volume, an observer-effect budget; a recorder that perturbs the device-under-test is a §11.4.128 violation, NOT evidence. (2) **Background + parallel + subagent-driven** per §11.4.103 + §11.4.70 — never blocks the main stream. (3) **Token-conscious — record-now, analyse-later** — raw data NOT processed without need; the only standing analyse-trigger is release-tag prep (§11.4.40 / §11.4.42) OR explicit operator ask. (4) **Raw is git-ignored (with a §11.4.77 regen-mechanism declaration) AND code-intelligence-excluded (§11.4.78/§11.4.79)** — only CURATED evidence is committed, and only at release prep under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` (§11.4.83). (5) **Deterministic layout** `<recording-root>/YYYY-MM-DD/<combined main+submodules state hash>/<DEVICE>_<SERIAL>/recording_NNN/<files>`. (6) **Anti-bluff** — a recorder claimed running but with no growing corpus is a §11.4 bluff; every curated finding traces to a real raw-corpus path; recorder health is itself captured evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69.

Composes §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.13 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.70 / §11.4.77 / §11.4.78 / §11.4.79 / §11.4.83 / §11.4.103 / §11.4.119. Classification: universal (§11.4.17).

### §11.4.129 — Huge-blocker release protocol (User mandate, 2026-06-06)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (2026-06-06):** when a huge blocker is discovered during release validation we MUST stop all testing, fix ALL discovered issues, process all recorded data from the last session, land rock-solid fixes, author NEW validation+verification tests of ALL supported test types, rebuild, reflash, and RESTART the full validation+verification of every fix/change from the last release tag to now — on both devices in parallel, recorded, with real physical captured proofs and no bluff.

On discovery of a HUGE BLOCKER (release-blocking-severity defect: core user-facing capability broken, regression invalidating the in-flight cycle, or blast radius reaching the batch's other fixes) during release validation, execute in order with NO spot-check shortcut: (1) **STOP all testing** on every device (the §11.4.4 test-interrupt STOP at release granularity — continuing past a huge blocker is the §11.4 PASS-bluff). (2) **Fix ALL discovered issues** — not just the blocker; root-cause each per §11.4.102 + isolate regressions against the last known-good tag per §11.4.114. (3) **Process all recorded data from the last session** — analyse the §11.4.128 raw-corpus slice (this IS the §11.4.128(3) release-prep analyse-trigger). (4) **Land rock-solid fixes** per §11.4.123 + §11.4.43/§11.4.115 + §11.4.9. (5) **Author NEW validation+verification tests of ALL supported test types** per §11.4.27 + §11.4.85, each anti-bluff + paired §1.1 mutation. (6) **Rebuild (full, not module-only) + reflash to a CLEAN target** per §11.4.108. (7) **RESTART the full validation+verification from the last release tag to now** per §11.4.40 — RESTART, never resume — on both/all owned devices IN PARALLEL per §11.4.103/§11.4.119, every run RECORDED per §11.4.128, real physical captured proofs per §11.4.5/§11.4.69/§11.4.107, no bluff. This anchor BINDS the existing release anchors for the huge-blocker case (adds STOP→fix-all→process-recordings→new-tests-all-types→rebuild→reflash→full-restart + the restart-not-resume rule), citing them rather than duplicating.

### §11.4.130 — Post-remediation validate-the-fix-FIRST-after-redeploy (User mandate, 2026-06-06)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (2026-06-06):** when a blocker discovered during release validation is fixed and a new artifact (rebuild / new flashing image / redeploy) is produced + the target reflashed, we MUST first re-test the SPECIFIC last-failing features + validate the just-incorporated fixes BEFORE the broader / full validation.

When a blocker / critical failure found during release validation is FIXED and a new artifact is produced + the target reflashed / redistributed / updated, the agent MUST: (1) **re-test the SPECIFIC last-failing features FIRST** (targeted guard tests for exactly the defects this fix addressed) BEFORE any broader / full-suite validation; (2) **validate the just-incorporated fixes with real captured evidence** — the §11.4.115 RED test flips GREEN at `RED_MODE=0` on the new artifact AND the §11.4.108 runtime-signature verifies on the CLEAN target the redeploy produced (metadata-only / config-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime PASS forbidden per §11.4 / §11.4.1; proof per §11.4.5/§11.4.69/§11.4.107/§11.4.123); (3) **only after the targeted fix is CONFIRMED working** proceed to the §11.4.40 full retest from the last tag to now. Rationale: a first fix attempt may not work / may be incomplete / may regress again under the new artifact — confirming the targeted fix FIRST catches a fix-did-not-take case immediately instead of hours later at the END of a full cycle (then restarting per §11.4.129); cheap-confirmation-first is §11.4.82 applied to the post-blocker reflash. This is the §11.4.46 recent-work-validation gate specialised for the post-blocker-reflash case + the targeted-confirmation phase that GATES §11.4.129's step-7 full-restart. Honest boundary (§11.4.6): "the fix probably took" ≠ "the fix took" — the RED→GREEN flip + runtime-signature on the new artifact is the proof; a still-FAILing targeted re-test re-enters the §11.4.114/§11.4.115 isolate→RED→fix loop, never proceeds to the full cycle on a still-broken fix.

### §11.4.131 — Standing session-resumption file mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-07)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-07):** "Make this markdown a standard file which will be written EVERY TIME when we need fresh session out of the box! It MUST BE always up to date and in sync so whenever new session is created all we have to do is just point to it!"

Every project MUST maintain a SINGLE canonical, always-current **session-resumption file** at a fixed, project-declared standard path (declared once per §11.4.35, never moved without a §11.4.66 operator decision). This file is the OUT-OF-THE-BOX entry point for any fresh session: creating a new session requires ONLY pointing the new agent at this one file. §11.4.131 promotes §11.4.127 (PREPARE a resumption prompt on demand) into a STANDING, version-controlled ARTIFACT — ALWAYS present, ALWAYS in sync. (A) **Existence + fixed path** — exists at the declared path at all times, encoded as a literal path in the project-layer instantiation (§11.4.35), never silently moved. (B) **Always written + always synced** — (re)written whenever a fresh session is needed OR the live state materially changes (new HEAD, build/artifact id, phase, device/target state, in-flight job, blocking decision) — the §12.10 trigger set; a stale resumption file is a §11.4.131 violation of the same severity class as a §12.10 stale-CONTINUATION violation. (C) **Content (composes §11.4.127)** — both SHORT + FULL variants; points to `.remember/remember.md` + `docs/CONTINUATION.md` read FIRST + `git fetch`; embeds exact live-state anchors (HEAD, build/artifact ids + checksums, device serials, in-flight PIDs + log paths, captured-evidence paths); states PHASE + immediate NEXT + terminal goal; restates binding constraints (anti-bluff §11.4, no-force-push §11.4.113, exact version/naming, hardware gotchas); MOMENT-VALID, never a generic template (§11.4.6). (D) **Export + freshness** — §11.4.65 scope (synchronized `.html`/`.pdf` siblings) + §11.4.44 revision header. (E) **Out-of-the-box resumption** — a fresh session, given ONLY this file's path, fully resumes with zero additional context.

### §11.4.132 — Risk-ordered validation priority mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-07)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-07):** "We MUST ALWAYS first test and validate features, functionalities and fixes/changes that have been worked most recently, the ones which were most problematic, which have the most chance to crash or break again, the ones which have been re-opened the most times! Then, after we validate and verify all this with real (physical) proofs and hard evidence, with no false results and bluffs of any kind, we continue with all other existing tests in the test suites! This IS MANDATORY."

Tests / validations / verifications MUST run in **RISK-DESCENDING order** — the highest-risk set FIRST, and ONLY AFTER that set is fully GREEN with real (physical) captured evidence does the remainder of the suite run. Risk ranking is computed from a CLOSED set of factors, highest-risk first: (a) **most-recently-worked** features / fixes / changes; (b) **historically most-problematic** (longest defect history, most prior fixes/failures); (c) **highest crash/break/regress likelihood** (greatest blast radius / complexity / dependency surface); (d) **most-reopened** per §11.4.55 reopens-count (a high reopen count is the strongest empirical fragility signal). Each item in the highest-risk set MUST pass with real (physical) captured evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69/§11.4.107 — no metadata-only / config-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime PASS (§11.4/§11.4.1), no false results, no bluff (§11.4.6). ONLY AFTER the entire highest-risk set is GREEN with captured proof does the rest of the suite run; running the suite in arbitrary order, or running lower-risk tests before the highest-risk set is GREEN, is a §11.4.132 violation. §11.4.132 REFINES/STRENGTHENS §11.4.130 (generalises "validate the just-fixed items first" to the full risk-ordered set) + §11.4.46 (adds explicit risk-ordering within the recent/high-risk set) + §11.4.42 (applies the implementation-layer priority discipline to VALIDATION ordering). Classification: universal (§11.4.17) — the consuming project supplies its recency / problematic-history / reopen-count sources (e.g. §11.4.93 workable-items DB `reopens_count`+`last_modified`) per §11.4.35.

### §11.4.133 — Target-System + hardware safety mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-08)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-08):** "Make sure that all changes we do to the System are ALWAYS safe for the System itself and for the hardware the system runs on! This is MANDATORY."

Every change to the TARGET system (firmware, kernel, init/boot scripts, drivers, sysfs/devfreq/voltage/clock/thermal/regulator register writes, partition/bootloader/U-Boot, HAL, framework, prebuilts, device config) MUST ALWAYS be safe for BOTH (a) the target System itself — MUST NOT brick, boot-loop, corrupt data, or render the device unrecoverable — AND (b) the hardware it runs on — MUST NOT exceed safe electrical/thermal/voltage/clock limits or damage panels/storage/radios/regulators. Concrete obligations: (1) reversible-first — verify irreversible high-blast-radius changes (bootloader/U-Boot MD5, partition layout) against known-good values + capture a pre-op backup (§9.2) BEFORE applying; (2) NO unverified hardware-control writes — never write an unverified value to a voltage/clock/regulator/thermal-throttle/current-limit sysfs node or register that could exceed datasheet limits, the safe range established as FACT (§11.4.6), never guessed; (3) thermal/perf changes (forcing a performance governor, pinning the top OPP, disabling thermal management) MUST respect the device's cooling design, validated by captured thermal evidence; (4) flashing MUST use the sanctioned tool + a freshly-built integrity-verified image — never an ad-hoc partition write or stale/unverified artifact; (5) unprovable-safety ⇒ blocked — a change whose target/hardware safety cannot be established from captured evidence is treated as UNSAFE and blocked (§11.4.6 + §11.4.101 reversible-first + §11.4.123 rock-solid-proof). DISTINCT from §12 host-session safety: §12 protects the DEVELOPER's HOST + session; §11.4.133 protects the TARGET device + its hardware — both apply, neither weakens the other. Classification: universal (§11.4.17) — the consuming project supplies its concrete hardware-control surfaces, datasheet-safe ranges, known-good bootloader/image hashes, and sanctioned flashing tool per §11.4.35.

### §11.4.134 — Code-review iterate-until-GO + rock-solid-evidence mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-08)

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-06-08):** "For any fixes/changes given back to us for re-work by the code-review process, once we fix/improve everything per the code-review's requests, we MUST RE-RUN code-review AGAIN until we get a GO from it with NO new issues reported or warnings of any kind! All results produced by this whole process MUST ALWAYS give us rock-solid PHYSICAL evidence that the fixed/improved codebase really works now as expected, with no false results and no bluff(s) of any kind."

When the §11.4.125 code-review returns ANY finding — BLOCKING, nit, or warning — and the author fixes/improves the batch per that review, the code review MUST BE RE-RUN, and MUST KEEP being re-run after each remediation round, until it returns a clean GO with ZERO new issues AND ZERO warnings of any kind. A single pass that "addressed the findings" is NOT sufficient: the corrected batch MUST pass a FRESH adversarial review (a re-review can surface NEW findings introduced by the very fixes that closed the prior ones — the §11.4.1 fix-A-creates-B failure mode). The loop terminates ONLY on a clean GO (no new findings, no warnings); a residual warning is itself a finding that re-arms the loop. Every round's verdict AND every fix's validation MUST carry rock-solid PHYSICAL captured evidence per §11.4.5 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107 (captured audio / video / sysfs / dumpsys / sink-side / runtime-signature) proving the fixed/improved codebase REALLY works as expected — never metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime; no false results, no bluff at any round; a reported GO unbacked by captured physical evidence is itself a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the review-loop layer. §11.4.134 REFINES / STRENGTHENS §11.4.125 (iterate "until no blocking findings remain"): it makes the loop EXPLICIT (re-run after every remediation round, not once), raises termination to ZERO findings AND ZERO warnings (not merely zero-blocking), and BINDS rock-solid physical evidence to every round. Classification: universal (§11.4.17). Composes §11.4.125 / §11.4.1 / §11.4.4 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.107 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.108 / §11.4.123.

**§11.4.135 — Standing regression-guard suite + every-fixed-defect-gets-a-permanent-regression-test (User mandate, 2026-06-08).** Every project MUST maintain a STANDING regression-guard suite that runs on EVERY build+deploy and BLOCKS the release tag on any failure. Every closed defect (stable ticket id, e.g. ATM-NNN) MUST, in the SAME commit as its fix (extending the §11.4.43 DOCUMENT step), register a permanent §11.4.115 RED-on-broken-artifact regression test into the suite — `RED_MODE=1` capturing the historical defect on a pre-fix artifact (the proof the guard is real), `RED_MODE=0` the standing GREEN guard asserting the defect is ABSENT. A closure without a registered guard is a §11.4.123 violation. The suite runs FIRST in the post-deploy cycle (highest-risk set per §11.4.132) and is a §11.4.40 release-gate blocker. Forensic anchor (FACT): the wrong-subtitle-on-2nd-display defect was "fixed" via a source-side `CONTROL_MENU_LABEL_DENYLIST` that NO test mirrored or re-ran, so the NEXT chrome class recurred silently while the GREEN suite passed.

**§11.4.136 — Real-content end-to-end playback-test mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-08).** Refines/strengthens §11.4.107. Any test asserting media playback works MUST drive REAL content (catalog stream or offline reference clip) through the user's path (§11.4.48 UI-driven → §11.4.117 CV/OCR fallback) and assert it genuinely PLAYS via the §11.4.107 liveness battery PLUS a decoder-health census — a numeric drop-buffer budget, no buffer-timestamp re-order/discard, no codec-reject (cite Android/Media3 ExoPlayer OEM pre-OTA playback-test mandate: "too many dropped buffers" >25, "unexpected presentation timestamp", "test timed out").

**§11.4.137 — Subtitle/caption content-correctness oracle + secure-display-proxy-honesty mandate (User mandate, 2026-06-08).** Refines §11.4.117 + §11.4.107 + §11.4.112. Forensic anchor (FACT): tests tasked to "physically verify the 2nd-display subtitle" PASSed GREEN while subtitles did NOT show / showed WRONG — the streaming player surface is FLAG_SECURE so `screencap -d <secondary>` returns BLACK (autonomous PIXEL verification structurally impossible per §11.4.112), so the test fell back to the accessibility-scraped/`persist.atmosphere.subdebug` proxy, and the proxy accepted a chrome/menu LABEL (`Аудио и субтитры`) as a valid subtitle because the prose floor accepted any multibyte prose and NO menu-label denylist + NO position/cadence check existed. The mandate: a subtitle-correctness test MUST classify the cue's *content class* — a present cue is NOT a correct cue. CHROME (FAIL) if a known control/menu label (closed multilingual deny-list MIRRORED from source, case-folded incl. non-ASCII), time/numeric chrome, not prose, OUTSIDE the lower safe-title band (CEA-708 9-anchor grid), OR STATIC across the window (real subtitle changes → ≥2 distinct prose cues, a metamorphic relation). DIALOGUE (PASS) only when prose + not-denied + not-chrome + position-ok + cadence ≥2 OR fuzzy-matches the SOURCE-extracted cue via normalized edit distance (§11.4.123 host ground truth). The oracle MUST be self-validated golden-good/golden-bad (§11.4.107(10)) and the deny-list MUST be verified present in the SHIPPED artifact (§11.4.108) — a source-green denylist with no test mirror + no artifact check is the exact recurrence pattern forbidden here. Secure-display honesty (§11.4.112): where FLAG_SECURE makes pixel verification impossible, the rock-solid autonomous proof is the player's caption telemetry + source-track presence + content-class oracle — NEVER a faked pixel "physical" pass; human-eye pixel confirmation is `operator_attended` (§11.4.52) with a tracked migration item.

**§11.4.138 — Operator-escape => mandatory bluff-audit + permanent guard (User mandate, 2026-06-08).** When the operator (or any out-of-band channel) finds a defect that the GREEN test suite passed, this is by definition a §11.4 PASS-bluff — it MUST trigger, before the fix is closed: (1) a §11.4.102 systematic-debugging pass to FACT-root-cause; (2) a bluff-audit identifying the EXACT assertion that should have caught it but didn't, cited to `file:line` (canonical example: `lib/subtitle_content_validation.sh:sub_is_prose()` returning TRUE for `Аудио и субтитры`); (3) a permanent §11.4.135 regression guard registered in the SAME commit as the fix, with its §11.4.115 RED capturing the operator-found defect; (4) the bluff-audit committed under `docs/research/<scope>/<defect>_bluff_audit/`.

Before any post-deploy validation — ESPECIALLY a non-pixel proxy verification (the subdebug/accessibility-cue channel used for FLAG_SECURE displays) — the harness MUST assert running-artifact == built-artifact: the deploy yielded a CLEAN target (mutable-overlay/userdata wiped) OR a pre-validation check proves no stale overlay shadows the deployed code (e.g. every guarded package — incl. the Presenter that emits the subtitle cue — resolves to the system partition, no per-user override). A stale shadow of the cue-emitting component (e.g. a Presenter APK predating the denylist) makes the proxy report on code that was never deployed — any PASS is a §11.4 PASS-bluff. Each fix declares ONE machine-checkable runtime signature verified on the clean target (the §11.4.108 registry IS the definition of done); for the subtitle class the signature is "the shipped Presenter APK contains the denylist literal (case-insensitive) AND the subdebug channel emits `candidate REJECTED reason=chrome-label` for a menu label."

> **§11.4.140 — Universal action-prefix system (`ACTION_NAME ::`) (User mandate,
> 2026-06-09; GRAMMAR_ADDENDUM 2026-06-09).** When a user prompt's FIRST

> (2) if it is a registered action, REPLACE the prefix with that action's
> `expansion` text and apply its `rules`; (3) execute the remainder of the prompt
> under the expanded instruction. **Four EQUIVALENT forms** — same action, same
> expansion, same execution: (1) `ACTION_NAME :: <rest>` (bare `::`),
> (2) `PREFIX::ACTION_NAME :: <rest>` (namespaced `::`), (3) `/ACTION_NAME <rest>`
> (bare slash), (4) `/PREFIX::ACTION_NAME <rest>` (namespaced slash). Thus
> `BACKGROUND :: x` ≡ `DEFAULT::BACKGROUND :: x` ≡ `/BACKGROUND x` ≡
> `/DEFAULT::BACKGROUND x`. `PREFIX` is an action NAMESPACE; the reserved default
> namespace is **`DEFAULT`**, and an action runs WITH or WITHOUT the prefix.
> Grammar (all hold): anchored at the FIRST non-blank line only (mid-prose tokens
> never match); the action token AND the namespace are UPPERCASE-only
> `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*` (lowercase never matches); the namespace separator `::`

> avoids C++ `Foo::Bar`, YAML `key: value`, URLs) in forms 1/2 and the slash-body
> separator (one space) in forms 3/4; stacked prefixes (`A :: B :: rest`) apply
> outer-to-inner, left-to-right (expand `A`, re-scan, expand `B`, then the
> residual is the task); a leading `\` escapes the prefix for BOTH the `::` and
> the slash form (`\BACKGROUND :: x`, `\/BACKGROUND x` — treat literally, strip
> the backslash, NO expansion) so action names can be discussed. **Conflict rule
> (slash form):** `/ACTION_NAME` (form 3) is honored as the action ONLY when
> `ACTION_NAME` (case-folded) does not collide with a built-in/host slash command
> (registry `slash_bare: auto` + `slash_conflicts: [..]`); form 4

**§11.4.141 — Token-efficiency mandate (research-derived + operator mandate, 2026-06-09).** Every project worked on by AI coding agents MUST cut token spend (input AND output) toward **30–40% of current (a 60–70% reduction)** WITHOUT degrading quality/performance/safety or breaking any existing mechanism, via a composable, safety-ranked measure set: (1) **prompt-cache the static governance prefix** — the always-loaded governance forms a byte-stable cache-breakpointed prefix with no volatile bytes ahead of it; cache reads cost ~0.1× base input (the dominant cost driver — measured ~170K tokens of governance re-sent every turn, externally corroborated by Claude Code issue #24147); caching is transparent so it removes no rule, weakens no gate, changes no verdict — only billing (PRIMARY, biggest + safest lever); (2) **subagent model-tiering + output-to-file** — mechanical non-judgment work (search/grep/status/doc-export/read-only probes) to a Haiku-class model, the strong model RESERVED for all reasoning/verdicts/fix-design (§11.4.102)/code-review (§11.4.125)/demotion (§11.4.7), large output persisted to a file not an inline 350–520K-token transcript; the cheap model never emits a PASS so §11.4.50 + anti-bluff are untouched; (3) **thin always-loaded INDEX + on-demand detail** — concise index (one line per fix/anchor, EACH carrying the literal `11.4.N` token so propagation gates pass) with the canonical full text kept gate-scanned in `constitution/Constitution.md` and reachable in one hop — a de-duplication realising §11.4.35, never a deletion; (4) **CodeGraph/retrieval-first over full-file loading** (§11.4.78/§11.4.79); (5) **output-token reduction** — terse status + `effort:"low"` on the mechanical allowlist only; (6) **tool-call batching + no re-reads**; (7) **compaction/context-editing for long sessions**. **Mandatory measured proof:** a token-accounting harness measures tokens-per-development-cycle BEFORE vs AFTER on a frozen deterministic workload from the authoritative `usage` object (input/cache_read/cache_creation/output split; NEVER `tiktoken`, NEVER the client-side cost estimate), reproduced N times (§11.4.50), pass = AFTER ≤ 40% of BEFORE OR the measured best-safe reduction with a cited cold-cache reason; the AFTER run MUST show ZERO regression on the pre-build sweep + meta-test mutation sweep + propagation gates + a strong-model reasoning probe + a cache-warm proof (`cache_read_input_tokens > 0`) — cost reduction with quality regression is a §11.4 FAIL.

## §11.4.109 — Mandatory Anti-Forgetting Enforcement: PreToolUse Guard Hook + Subagent Constitutional Preamble + Orchestrator Pre-Action Checklist (Operator mandate)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.109 for the full mandate. Every consumer MUST wire `constitution/scripts/hooks/guard-forbidden-commands.sh` as a `PreToolUse` hook, maintain `docs/AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md` with the subagent constitutional preamble and orchestrator pre-action checklist, and provide a hermetic hook test suite. The hook is inherited by reference, never copied. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-109-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.109`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.109.

## §11.4.111 — Resolve-by-stable-name-not-by-enumeration-index mandate (research-derived, 2026-06-03)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.111 for the full mandate. Any binding to a hardware device / resource handle / enumerated entity MUST resolve by a stable identifier (name / UUID / serial / label) and MUST NOT bind by enumeration index / ordinal / slot unless the platform documents that ordinal as deterministically pinned and the pin is captured + asserted. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-111-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.111`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

## §11.4.116 — Real-time conductor↔autonomous-test-framework sync channel mandate (1.1.8-dev remediation, 2026-06-03)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.116 for the full mandate. Any autonomous long-running test/QA/validation framework MUST expose a structured append-only event stream and an atomically-rewritten status snapshot. Every verdict event MUST carry the evidence path that backs it. A PASS event with no evidence path is a channel-layer PASS-bluff. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-116-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.116`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

## §11.4.120 — Fix-breaks-its-own-gate reconciliation mandate (1.1.8-dev remediation, 2026-06-03)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.120 for the full mandate. When a correct fix causes a pre-existing gate/test to FAIL because it asserted old behaviour, the gate MUST be reconciled (rewritten to assert the new mechanism + paired §1.1 mutation updated) — never fake-passed, weakened to a tautology, or deleted; and the correct fix MUST NOT be reverted to satisfy the stale gate. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-120-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.120`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.120.

## §11.4.121 — No-commit-while-build-writes-tracked-artifacts mandate (1.1.8-dev remediation, 2026-06-03)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.121 for the full mandate. A commit MUST NOT run while a build/packaging/generation step is actively writing artifacts into tracked (version-controlled) directories. The commit MUST be deferred until the writing step completes so the tree is quiescent and committed artifacts are the fresh, whole outputs. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-121-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.121`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.121.

## §11.4.103 — Continuous parallel-stream working routine (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.103)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.103 for the full mandate. The endless fully-autonomous loop default (§11.4.87/§11.4.126) MUST run as a continuous parallel-stream routine: the main stream stays FREE (all commits + pushes detached per §11.4.88); at least 3 background subagent streams run concurrently and auto-backfill when any completes; audio-first + most-critical-first priority (§11.4.72/§11.4.42); safe-during-build scope only (§11.4.96); idle ONLY when genuinely externally blocked. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-103-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.103`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.103.

## §11.4.104 — Participant identity, attribution & notification-tagging (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.104)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.104 for the full mandate. Every consumer that ships a messenger/notification surface MUST model participants as logical subscribers with per-channel aliases, carry `created_by` + `assigned_to` on workable items, apply the tagging matrix (tag assigned-to/created-by humans who are not the Operator and not the system agent `Claude`), and anti-bluff the full implementation per §11.4. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-104-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.104`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.104.

## §11.4.105 — Natural-language intent recognition & clarification (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.105)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.105 for the full mandate. Users MUST NOT be required to know command syntax; they send plain natural language and the system determines the intent via three-tier resolution (command match → intent inference → tagged clarifying reply). Never guess, never silently drop a message. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-105-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.105`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.105.

## §11.4.106 — Docs Chain — mechanical documentation/DB sync engine (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.106)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.106 for the full mandate. Every consumer MUST use the `vasic-digital/docs_chain` engine (inherited by reference, never copied) as the canonical mechanical enforcer of all documentation-sync mandates; register chains via per-context YAML; never accept a faked transform. Ad-hoc sync scripts are superseded. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-106-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.106`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.106.

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.107 for the full mandate. Every test asserting audio/video output is genuinely playing MUST prove live advancing frames (freeze-detection oracle + independent frame-advance counter), not-stale-from-previous cross-check, no-flash-on-wrong-output, metamorphic relations, full-reference quality metrics, mutation-tested analyzers with golden-good/golden-bad fixtures, per-channel audio RMS, and calibrated thresholds. A single captured frame is NOT proof. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-107-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.107`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.107.

## §11.4.108 — Four-layer fix-verification + runtime-signature-as-definition-of-done mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.108)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.108 for the full mandate. A fix crosses four distinct layers: SOURCE → ARTIFACT → RUNTIME-ON-CLEAN-TARGET → USER-VISIBLE. Green at layer 1 says nothing about layers 2–4. Every fix declares one machine-checkable runtime signature verified on a clean target; gates span all four layers; deployment MUST yield a clean state or a pre-validation assertion proves running-artifact == built-artifact. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-108-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.108`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.108.

## §11.4.109 — Mandatory Anti-Forgetting Enforcement: PreToolUse Guard Hook + Subagent Constitutional Preamble + Orchestrator Pre-Action Checklist (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.109)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.109 for the full mandate. Every consumer MUST wire `constitution/scripts/hooks/guard-forbidden-commands.sh` as a `PreToolUse` hook, maintain `docs/AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md` with the subagent constitutional preamble and orchestrator pre-action checklist, and provide a hermetic hook test suite. The hook is inherited by reference, never copied. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-109-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.109`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

## §11.4.110 — Pre-build build-readiness verdict + change-impact clash detection mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.110)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.110 for the full mandate. A single deterministic READY-FOR-BUILD verdict gates every rebuild; a diff-driven change-impact clash detector cross-checks every newly-introduced second-artifact dependency; coverage-completeness is a gate; every gate is anti-bluff by paired §1.1 mutation. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-110-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.110`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.110.

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.111 for the full mandate. Any binding to a hardware device / resource handle / enumerated entity MUST resolve by a stable identifier (name / UUID / serial / label) and MUST NOT bind by enumeration index / ordinal / slot unless the platform documents that ordinal as deterministically pinned and the pin is captured + asserted.

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.112 for the full mandate. When deep research per §11.4.8 PROVES a goal is structurally impossible by platform design, it MUST be classified `Won't-fix` + closed with `structurally-impossible` reason, documented with cited authoritative sources + reproducible evidence, and NOT re-attempted without new evidence that the platform constraint changed. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-112-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.112`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.112.

## §11.4.113 — Absolute no-force-push + merge-onto-latest-main mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.113)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.113 for the full mandate. Force-push is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN with NO exception. Every publish follows the 6-step integration: fetch all remotes → base on latest main tip → carefully merge all changes on top → resolve conflicts → commit → push to ALL upstreams (fast-forward only, so no force is ever needed). Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-113-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.113`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.113.

## §11.4.114 — Last-known-good-tag regression isolation mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.114)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.114 for the full mandate. When a previously-working feature is observed broken, the FIRST diagnostic action MUST be to identify the last known-good tag and diff/bisect against it BEFORE any open-ended root-cause hunt. Default to a surgical forward-fix keeping post-good-tag features; revert only with operator preference. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-114-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.114`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.114.

## §11.4.115 — RED-baseline-on-the-broken-artifact + polarity-switch mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.115)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.115 for the full mandate. Every RED test MUST reproduce the defect on the current pre-fix artifact with captured positive evidence. The same test source carries a polarity switch (`RED_MODE`, default `1` = reproduce defect, `0` = regression guard). One source, two roles. RED-on-broken then GREEN-on-fixed (on a clean target) MUST both be captured. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-115-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.115`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.116 for the full mandate. Any autonomous long-running test/QA/validation framework MUST expose a structured append-only event stream and an atomically-rewritten status snapshot. Every verdict event MUST carry the evidence path that backs it. A PASS event with no evidence path is a channel-layer PASS-bluff. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-116-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.116`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

## §11.4.117 — Computer-vision / OCR pixel-oracle fallback for non-introspectable UIs mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.117)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.117 for the full mandate. When the accessibility/semantic hierarchy is blank/partial/unreliable for the app under test, tests MUST fall back to a pixel oracle: CV template-match to drive input by rendered appearance; ROI OCR with per-word confidence floor + region-of-interest to assert on-screen content. The analyzer is self-validated with golden-good/golden-bad fixtures. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-117-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.117`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.117.

## §11.4.118 — Discovery-pressure to confirm known-issue-set completeness mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.118)

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.118 for the full mandate. After fixing reported defects, the cycle MUST run a discovery + stress pass across ALL target environments deliberately exercising subsystems, journeys, and edge cases BEYOND reported defects, producing an enumerated list of subsystems/journeys actually exercised with outcomes. "We found no other issues" without an enumerated coverage list is a §11.4 bluff. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-118-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.118`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.

Cascade reference — see constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.119 for the full mandate. When multiple parallel streams exercise shared hardware or exclusive-access resources, exactly ONE stream MUST own each resource at a time; all others MUST be read-only. Ownership is enforced by an advisory lock/token, event-driven (claim when free, release when done). Concurrent drivers of one exclusive resource produce cross-contaminated evidence — a PASS under contention is a §11.4 evidence-integrity bluff. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-119-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.119`). Non-compliance is a release blocker.
